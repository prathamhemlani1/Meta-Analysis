37963420,Impact of sociodemographic and economic determinants of health on COVID-19 infection: incidence variation between reference periods.,"The COVID-19 pandemic hit Portugal in March 2020, causing widespread disruption to various aspects of society. While extensive research has been conducted on the significance of socio-economic disparities in infection risk, this study aims to enhance our understanding of their evolving relationship over time by analysing four distinct periods in 2020."
37963299,Learning from history in the midst of the COVID-19: epidemics/pandemics of antiquity up to the fall of the Western Roman Empire.,"When humans discovered agriculture and livestock, they ceased to be nomads and began to settle in towns until they created large cities. From the first human settlements in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Anatolian Peninsula, populations were exposed and susceptible to new infectious agents, leading to epidemics and pandemics. Great civilizations emerged, such as Egypt, the land of Hatti, Israel, Greece, Carthage, and Rome, among others. Contact between different populations through wars or maritime trade is well documented and has been described as a source of epidemics throughout history. Epidemics described as plagues or pestilences, such as those of Egypt, the Hebrews, or the Hittites, are based on biblical texts or evidence such as tablets or hieroglyphic writings. We also reviewed classical books by authors such as Homer, Aeschylus, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, Thucydides, Diodorus Siculus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Titus Livius, Suetonius, and others; and described all epidemics/pandemics chronologically. This article describes the epidemics/pandemics for which there is written evidence from ancient Egypt to the fall of the Roman Empire. We should not be surprised when new epidemics/pandemics appear as causes of political and economic collapse, as this has been common throughout history, decimating, blocking, or even destroying cultures and civilizations repeatedly."
37963149,The impact of confirmed cases of COVID-19 on residents' traditional Chinese medicine health literacy: A survey from Gansu Province of China.,"Since the outbreak of the new crown epidemic in China in early 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has continued to increase, and the Chinese government's policy of ""static management"" in the first round of the epidemic may affect the health behavior adjustment of Chinese residents. Using survey data on the TCM health literacy of 4016 residents in China (Gansu Province), a causal inference approach was used to explore the impact of the emergence of confirmed cases of COVID-19 on residents' TCM health literacy. We found that the emergence of confirmed cases can increase by 3.5%-7.0% in residents' TCM health literacy. Among them, the TCM health literacy of uneducated residents has not improved significantly, and the residents with secondary education have increased significantly by 8%. For those with higher education, the number of residents increased significantly by 6%. At the same time, the emergence of confirmed cases will increase the residents' practical TCM health literacy and decrease theoretical TCM health literacy. Through heterogeneity analysis, we explored the impact mechanism of confirmed cases on residents' TCM health literacy. We believe that the emergence of confirmed cases will make residents more inclined to participate in TCM-free clinics, theme activities, and other ways to acquire TCM knowledge."
37963128,Is the effect of a health crisis symmetric for physical and digital financial assets? An assessment of gold and bitcoin during the pandemic.,"The emergence of the covid-19 health crisis, in this advanced technological era where connections between markets, nations, and economies have grown stronger than ever before, the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic quickly had an impact on both physical and digital financial assets. The Chinese financial market experienced the first consequences of the covid-19 pandemic, then spilled over to other financial markets, including those for cryptocurrencies and the precious metals. This study examines the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the volatilities of the dynamics of bitcoin and gold. Both assets share some characteristics, such as online trading platforms, however, gold is a tangible financial asset unlike bitcoin, which is digitally generated without any physical form. This study argues that the similarities and differences between bitcoin and gold play major roles in how the covid-19 crisis affected their respective dynamics. Using daily data ranging from 9/22/2014 to 1/31/2023 and employing ARMA as the mean equation for GARCH model, the impact of the health crisis (covid-19) is examined on the volatilities of the prices and volumes of bitcoin and gold. Empirical evidence points out that, the pandemic has a symmetric impact on the volatilities of bitcoin and gold price returns, causing them to be more volatile. The impact of the covid-19 observed on the volume returns of the assets, however, is asymmetrical. The empirical results give evidence to the role that the vital differences existing between these assets played during the covid-19 pandemic."

37960821,Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on outpatient and inpatient revenues: A comparative analysis of large and small hospitals in Taiwan.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound effects on healthcare systems worldwide, not only by straining medical resources but also by significantly impacting hospital revenues. These economic repercussions have varied across different hospital departments and facility sizes. This study posits that outpatient (OPD) revenues experienced greater reductions than inpatient (IPD) revenues and that the financial impact was more profound in larger hospitals than in smaller hospitals."

The potential impact of the pandemic on mental health should not be overlooked, especially among vulnerable populations such as women who gave birth during the COVID-19 pandemic."
37957781,Young graduates and economic recession: Lessons from the pandemic to prevent the (re)incidence of mental health symptoms.,"Economic conditions affect the youth labour market and can leave deep scars. This exploratory study examines the emotional responses and mental health symptoms of young graduates during their transition into the labour market in the pandemic context. It draws on 42 news articles with statements from 86 graduates from a set of European and non-European countries. The graduates had jobs or internships cancelled, numerous applications unanswered or were dismissed from jobs they had recently started. Young people adopt a variety of coping strategies, which are often invisible and cause deep suffering due to anxiety, disappointment, fear, and depression. Their apprehension and uncertainty leave them in a state of limbo. The specific impacts of the pandemic on young people's lives serve as a warning of the need to protect future generations of graduates. More support is required worldwide to manage the mental health issues that affect young graduates, especially during economic recessions."
37956206,Bayesian spatial modelling of localised SARS-CoV-2 transmission through mobility networks across England.,"In the early phases of growth, resurgent epidemic waves of SARS-CoV-2 incidence have been characterised by localised outbreaks. Therefore, understanding the geographic dispersion of emerging variants at the start of an outbreak is key for situational public health awareness. Using telecoms data, we derived mobility networks describing the movement patterns between local authorities in England, which we have used to inform the spatial structure of a Bayesian BYM2 model. Surge testing interventions can result in spatio-temporal sampling bias, and we account for this by extending the BYM2 model to include a random effect for each timepoint in a given area. Simulated-scenario modelling and real-world analyses of each variant that became dominant in England were conducted using our BYM2 model at local authority level in England. Simulated datasets were created using a stochastic metapopulation model, with the transmission rates between different areas parameterised using telecoms mobility data. Different scenarios were constructed to reproduce real-world spatial dispersion patterns that could prove challenging to inference, and we used these scenarios to understand the performance characteristics of the BYM2 model. The model performed better than unadjusted test positivity in all the simulation-scenarios, and in particular when sample sizes were small, or data was missing for geographical areas. Through the analyses of emerging variant transmission across England, we found a reduction in the early growth phase geographic clustering of later dominant variants as England became more interconnected from early 2022 and public health interventions were reduced. We have also shown the recent increased geographic spread and dominance of variants with similar mutations in the receptor binding domain, which may be indicative of convergent evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants."
37956137,"Effects of COVID-19 outbreak on Korean adolescents: Impact of altered economic perception on physical activity, sedentary behavior, and stress levels in an age-, gender-, and BMI-matched study.","The current study is to examine the disparities in physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior (SB), and stress levels in Korean adolescents concerning changes in their perception of family economic status (ES) during COVID-19. Among a total of 6144 Korean adolescents aged 12 to 18, the participants were categorized into two groups based on their responses regarding changes in their family ES due to COVID-19: Declined ES (n = 3072) and Non-changed ES (n = 3072), with matching in terms of age, gender, and BMI. All variables were assessed using the 16th year (2020) of the Korean Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Statistical analyses were conducted using the SPSS 26.0 version, employing independent t-tests to examine anthropometrics' differences and multinominal logistic regression to predict the impact of perception of family ES on PA, SB, and stress while comparing the two groups. The significance level was set at α = 0.05. Adolescents in the Declined ES group were 1.2 times more likely to engage in MVPA for less than 420 mins/wk (OR = 1.16, p = 0.039), 1.7 times more likely to meet recommended muscular strength activities (i.e., ≥ 3 days/wk) (OR = 1.70, p < 0.001), 37% less likely to not meet recommended recreational sitting time (i.e., ≥ 840 mins/wk) (OR = 0.63, p < 0.01), and were 2.1 times more likely to experience very severe stress level than the Non-changed ES group (p < 0.001). These results shed light on the importance of promoting mental health care in adolescents, regardless of PA levels, for their well-being during potential future pandemics. Understanding the impact of perceived ES changes on health behaviors can inform targeted interventions and support strategies to improve the mental health outcomes of adolescents during challenging times."
37955906,Vaccine Nationalism Counterintuitively Erodes Public Trust in Leaders.,"Global access to resources like vaccines is key for containing the spread of infectious diseases. However, wealthy countries often pursue nationalistic policies, stockpiling doses rather than redistributing them globally. One possible motivation behind vaccine nationalism is a belief among policymakers that citizens will mistrust leaders who prioritize global needs over domestic protection. In seven experiments (total "
37954172,"COVID-19, people with disabilities, and the Italian government recovery: investigating the impact and promoting psychological resources to prevent future emergencies.","Given its profound and transversal impact, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 marked a deep point of division in how people make sense of the world and their lives. The consequences of this event were remarkable, especially for populations already facing vulnerability, exclusion, and discrimination. In Italy, over 3 million people (5.2% of the entire population) have a disability due to health issues or severe limitations that prevent them from performing daily activities. Although the COVID-19 health emergency aggravated and amplified these problems, research and studies investigating the incidence of psychological distress and the role of psychological resources for people with disabilities in the aftermath of the pandemic are still to be implemented. For these reasons, the Department of Psychology conducted a study on behalf of the Italian Government to assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social, psychological, and economic wellbeing of Italians with disabilities."
37951944,Rapid surveillance of New York City healthcare center egress behaviors during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown.,"This rapid response surveillance project was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to collect ""perishable"" data on egress behaviors and neighborhood conditions surrounding healthcare centers (HCCs) in New York City (NYC) during the initial NYC COVID-19 PAUSE ordinance from March 22nd to May 19th, 2020. Anonymized data on NYC HCC egress behaviors were collected by observational field workers using phone-based mapping applications. Each egress trip record includes the day of week, time of day, destination category type, along with an array of behavioral outcome categories, ambient weather conditions and socio-economic factors. Egress trajectories with precise estimates of distance traveled and the spatial dispersion or ""spread"" around each HCC were added via post-processing. The data collection and cleaning process resulted in 5,030 individual egress records from 18 facilities over a 9-week period."
37951763,The Economics of Small Animal Veterinary Practice.,"Recent economic cycles and unique factors like the COVID-19 pandemic have all affected small animal veterinary practice, changing both demand and supply-side factors. One-time events exacerbated cyclical macroeconomic factors, increasing the highs and worsening the lows. Behind the perceived labor shortage, the mental health concerns, and the challenges of staff turnover in the profession's daily work to meet client expectations and provide the best possible medical care lurks a productivity problem. The good news is that veterinary practices can take steps to improve productivity and resilience in the face of these challenging trends."

The standard method of monitoring hearing in the DoD is via multi-person testing in sound-treated booths using the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System-Hearing Conservation. COVID-19 significantly hindered the standard method, resulting in alarming declines in hearing readiness. In response, the Army Hearing Program initiated a pilot program to use boothless audiometers to supplement standard methods to increase hearing readiness."

37946719,Effects of social distancing policy on labor market outcomes.,"US workers receive unemployment benefits if they lose their job, but not for reduced working hours. In alignment with the benefits incentives, we find that the labor market responded to COVID-19 and related closure-policies mostly on the extensive (12 pp outright job loss) margin. Exploiting timing variation in state closure-policies, difference-in-differences (DiD) estimates show, between March 12 and April 12, 2020, employment rate fell by 1.7 pp for every 10 extra days of state stay-at-home orders (SAH), with little effect on hours worked/earnings among those employed. Forty percentage of the unemployment was due to a nationwide shock, rest due to social-distancing policies, particularly among ""non-essential"" workers."

37943837,"Inequality and COVID-19 in Sweden: Relative risks of nine bad life events, by four social gradients, in pandemic vs. prepandemic years.","The COVID-19 pandemic struck societies directly and indirectly, not just challenging population health but disrupting many aspects of life. Different effects of the spreading virus-and the measures to fight it-are reported and discussed in different scientific fora, with hard-to-compare methods and metrics from different traditions. While the pandemic struck some groups more than others, it is difficult to assess the comprehensive impact on social inequalities. This paper gauges social inequalities using individual-level administrative data for Sweden's entire population. We describe and analyze the relative risks for different social groups in four dimensions-gender, education, income, and world region of birth-to experience three types of COVID-19 incidence, as well as six additional negative life outcomes that reflect general health, access to medical care, and economic strain. During the pandemic, the overall population faced severe morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 and saw higher all-cause mortality, income losses and unemployment risks, as well as reduced access to medical care. These burdens fell more heavily on individuals with low income or education and on immigrants. Although these vulnerable groups experienced larger absolute risks of suffering the direct and indirect consequences of the pandemic, the relative risks in pandemic years (2020 and 2021) were conspicuously similar to those in prepandemic years (2016 to 2019)."
37943822,Nature and type of patient-reported safety incidents at a tertiary hospital in South Africa during the COVID-19 period (2018-2021)- A retrospective review.,"The healthcare sector in South Africa has seen a rise in medical errors and negligence adversely affecting healthcare delivery. This study aimed to determine the nature and magnitude of Patient Safety Incidents at a tertiary hospital between April 2018 to March 2021 (the COVID-19 era). A retrospective review of Patient Safety Incidents forms and clinical records of inpatients above 12 years with a reported incident were included. The overall incidence of patient safety incidents was 4.40 PSIs per 10 000 patient-days. The majority of PSIs were harmful incidents (An incident that results in harm to a patient that is related to medical management, in contrast to disease complications or underlying disease) at 72.50% [145/200], followed by no harm incidents at 18.00% [36/200] and 9.50% [19/200] near-miss incidents. The five highest incident types were clinical process/procedure [83/200; 41.50%], behaviour [49/200; 24.50%], falls [28/200; 14%], complications [20/200; 10%], and pressure sores [11/200; 5.50%]. Incidents occurred more frequently within the week (83.50%) and during day shift (67.50%). Overall, the study showed low PSI reporting rates which is an inherent challenge with voluntary reporting. Notably, there has been an increasing trend in reporting. The results reflect a reporting culture more inclined to bring awareness to incidents that have negative outcomes."
37943771,Improving social resilience amid the COVID-19 epidemic: A system dynamics model.,"Social resilience is a key factor in disaster management, but compared to resilience in other fields, research on social resilience is still limited to assessment or evaluation, and there is still a lack of dynamic and procedural research, which is also a challenge. This article constructs a causal feedback model and a system dynamics model of social resilience during the COVID-19 epidemic, so as to analyze the dynamic characteristics and improvement path of social resilience. After verifying the effectiveness of the model, model simulation is conducted and the following important conclusions are drawn: social resilience dynamically changes during the research cycle and is influenced by social entity behavior and social mechanisms; The sensitivity factors for the two variables that measure social resilience, namely panic degree and damage degree, are the real-time information acquisition of public and the epidemic awareness of local government, respectively. Therefore, the path to enhancing social resilience should be pursued from both the public and government perspectives, including improving the public's ability to access real-time information, increasing the timeline of government information disclosure, and enhancing local governments' understanding and awareness of the epidemic."

37943266,Telemedicine Versus Teledermatology Usage and Perception Among US-Based Physicians: A Survey Study.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked an increase in focus and use of telemedicine in several patient care settings. This survey study was distributed to actively practicing US-based physicians and examines telehealth use 2 years after the beginning of the COVID pandemic from a physician&rsquo;s perspective. Notable findings include telehealth benefits which include increased patient access and the ability to work from home. A continued drawback in telehealth visits is the limitations on a complete physical examination, a drawback that was emphasized by the dermatology community. While this study sheds light on the developing nature of telehealth, it is limited by its retrospective nature and sample size. Future research with larger sample sizes focusing on economic incentives and telemedicine training may help to overcome barriers to using telehealth.&nbsp; J Drugs Dermatol. 2023;22(11):e4-e8&nbsp; &nbsp; doi:10.36849/JDD.7386e."
37942705,Analysis of the influence of the COVID-19 outbreak on household solid waste management: An empirical study using PLS-SEM.,"The global increase in solid waste pollution due to economic growth and population growth has led to severe ecological deterioration. This situation is exacerbated by the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has significantly impacted consumer behavior and consumption habits. Proper management of solid waste has thus become critical in mitigating environmental degradation. In this study, we aim to examine the relationship between the outbreak of COVID-19, environmental attitudes (EATT), social norms (SN), environmental knowledge (EK), technological innovation (TI), and solid waste management (SWM) in Ecuadorian households during the pandemic. We collected data from 426 households in Ecuador using an online questionnaire and analyzed it using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model method to test the hypotheses. Likewise, we validated the measurement and structural model. The results are novel about SWM, considering a developing country severely affected during the pandemic. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 has a negative impact on SWM, while EATT, SN, and TI have a positive influence on SWM. However, we found that EK does not significantly affect SWM."

37941110,Public Health Response Measures for COVID-19 in Kazakhstan.,"The article describes measures developed to counter the spread of coronavirus infection in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Kazakhstan were detected on March 13, 2020, among people who arrived from Germany. After declaring the state of emergency in the country, the Ministry of Healthcare of the Republic of Kazakhstan began to formulate and implement a comprehensive package of measures aimed at slowing down and stopping the transmission of infection, preventing outbreaks, ensuring optimal care for all patients, especially the seriously ill, minimizing the negative impact of the pandemic on health systems, social services, and economic activities. Developed set of restrictive measures was approved by the Country Office of Word Health Organization (WHO) in Kazakhstan, being later adapted by the European Union (EU) countries and applied in Kyrgyzstan. In addition, article identifies Kazakhstan's experience in creating epidemiological surveillance systems, studying virus mutations, and the clinical aspects of dealing with it to combat the infection. It also indicates the impact of the epidemic on health-care workers and the development of measures to protect them, strengthening infection prevention, and control in medical organizations."
37940663,Emerging and re-emerging pediatric viral diseases: a continuing global challenge.,"The twenty-first century has been marked by a surge in viral epidemics and pandemics, highlighting the global health challenge posed by emerging and re-emerging pediatric viral diseases. This review article explores the complex dynamics contributing to this challenge, including climate change, globalization, socio-economic interconnectedness, geopolitical tensions, vaccine hesitancy, misinformation, and disparities in access to healthcare resources. Understanding the interactions between the environment, socioeconomics, and health is crucial for effectively addressing current and future outbreaks. This scoping review focuses on emerging and re-emerging viral infectious diseases, with an emphasis on pediatric vulnerability. It highlights the urgent need for prevention, preparedness, and response efforts, particularly in resource-limited communities disproportionately affected by climate change and spillover events. Adopting a One Health/Planetary Health approach, which integrates human, animal, and ecosystem health, can enhance equity and resilience in global communities. IMPACT: We provide a scoping review of emerging and re-emerging viral threats to global pediatric populations This review provides an update on current pediatric viral threats in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic This review aims to sensitize clinicians, epidemiologists, public health practitioners, and policy stakeholders/decision-makers to the role these viral diseases have in persistent pediatric morbidity and mortality."

In Brazil, a relative success of public policies was evidenced. However, the association between public policies and the ""flatten the curve"" objectives remain unclear, as well as the association of different policies to reach this aim. This study aims to verify if the adoption of different public policies was associated with the flattening of the infection and death curves by covid-19 first wave in 2020."
37937314,Discounting health gain: a different view.,"At least since the Age of Enlightenment, good health has been a tenet for society. Healthy societies could learn better, work harder, improve their wealth, and live longer. Today societies focus on life expectancy, as we value long and healthy lives. As illustrated by the provision of COVID-19 vaccines first for the elderly, societies value life-saving actions. Paradoxically, health economic assessments conventionally devalue long-lasting health through the practice of discounting health benefits along with costs. However, health, with its intrinsic and instrumental characteristics, is not synonymous with money cash, a tradeable asset that devalues with time. If improving healthy life expectancy is a societal ambition, it seems counter-intuitive to value future health less as a result of an artificial mathematical construct when evaluating economically new medical interventions. In this paper, we investigate the application of discounting health in healthcare and consider paradoxical findings, especially in relation to disease prevention with vaccination. We argue that there is no economically sustainable argument to discount health gains, except for the benefit of the payer with a goal of spending less on life-saving products. If that is the objective for discounting health, there are other means to achieve the same goal in a more transparent and simpler way. From the long-term perspective of healthcare development, not discounting health gains would encourage research that values long-term effects. This in turn has the potential to benefit the investor, the payer, and the patient/consumer, improving the situation from multiple perspectives."

The increased desirability of telepractice encouraged organisations to invest and correspondingly enhance access to services delivered remotely via digital technology including allied health therapy interventions. The investment and uptake of telepractice provided greater learning opportunities and ability to investigate telepractice implementation in specific contexts such as disability services, enabling service providers the ability to tailor to specific population needs."
37936695,Protection from infection and reinfection due to the Omicron BA.1 variant in care homes.,"Following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020, care homes were disproportionately impacted by high mortality and morbidity of vulnerable elderly residents.

The next step is to understand how these leaders contribute to the implementation of DEIB interventions, a task with notable salience due to not only the historical difficulties associated with DEIB strategy execution, but also the substantial evidence that leadership plays a significant role in implementation processes. Therefore, the objective of this qualitative study is to understand the role of top-level DEIB leaders in the implementation of healthcare organizational DEIB interventions."
37936094,Exploring the impact of population ageing on the spread of emerging respiratory infections and the associated burden of mortality.,"Increasing life expectancy and persistently low fertility levels have led to old population age structures in most high-income countries, and population ageing is expected to continue or even accelerate in the coming decades. While older adults on average have few interactions that potentially could lead to disease transmission, their morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases, respiratory infections in particular, remain substantial. We aim to explore how population ageing affects the future transmission dynamics and mortality burden of emerging respiratory infections."
37936037,"Research on transportation management model of COVID-19 medical waste: a case study in Beijing, China.","During the COVID-19 pandemic, disposable masks, protective clothing, gloves, and nasopharyngeal swabs collected by nucleic acid testing formed a large amount of medical waste. Medical waste has strict temporary storage time requirements in hospitals, which need to be transported to medical waste disposal plants within the specified time. However, as most of disposal plants are far away from downtown, they also need to be responsible for the transportation and disposal of medical waste in many hospitals, and put forward higher requirement for transportation routes. Rapid and safe disposal of all types of medical waste generated by COVID-19 is crucial to the prevention and control of the epidemic. This paper designs the transportation route optimization model using Anylogic simulation software based on the regional distribution of 118 tertiary hospitals and 2 large medical waste disposal plants in Beijing, China. At the same time, transportation routes of 118 tertiary hospitals in the morning peak, evening peak, all-day, and ordinary periods were simulated based on the Beijing traffic index in 2017. On this basis, through the analysis of the simulation data, the selection of medical waste transport routes for 118 tertiary hospitals in the morning peak, evening peak, all day, and ordinary periods is further clarified, so as to ensure that medical waste can be transported to the medical waste disposal plant in the shortest time. The shortest path and fastest speed transport mode, medical waste transport data set, and the selection of transport mode of 118 tertiary hospitals formed by this research provide certain reference experience for the rapid and safe transport of medical waste during the epidemic period, and also provides corresponding data support for medical waste transportation management in the post-epidemic era and medical waste transportation decision-making when facing major public health problems."
37935793,Platelet aggregates detected using quantitative phase imaging associate with COVID-19 severity.,"The clinical spectrum of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from an asymptomatic to life-threatening disease. Considering the broad spectrum of severity, reliable biomarkers are required for early risk stratification and prediction of clinical outcomes. Despite numerous efforts, no COVID-19-specific biomarker has been established to guide further diagnostic or even therapeutic approaches, most likely due to insufficient validation, methodical complexity, or economic factors. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is a hallmark of the disease and is mainly attributed to dysregulated immunothrombosis. This process describes an intricate interplay of platelets, innate immune cells, the coagulation cascade, and the vascular endothelium leading to both micro- and macrothrombotic complications. In this context, increased levels of immunothrombotic components, including platelet and platelet-leukocyte aggregates, have been described and linked to COVID-19 severity."

Although frequently used as an indicator of economic performance, GDP per capita does not directly reflect income distribution inequalities and imposed health costs. In this longitudinal ecological study, we aimed to determine if, besides GDP per capita, indicators relating to governance, public health measures enforcement, and health and research investment explain differences in RT-PCR testing rates among countries in Southeast Asia (SEA) during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using open-access COVID-19 panel data, we estimated the effect of various indicators (GDP per capita, health expenditure per capita, number of researchers per one million population, corruption perceptions index, stringency index, regional authority index) on daily COVID-19 testing by performing fixed-effects negative binomial regression. After accounting for all indicators, the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases, and population density, the model provided a 2019 GDP per capita coefficient of 0.0046330 (95% CI: 0.0040171, 0.0052488; p <0.001), indicating that a rise in 2019 GDP per capita by 100 international dollars is associated with a 46.33% increase in the number of daily tests performed. Additionally, all indicators were significantly associated with the daily number of RT-PCR testing on multivariable analysis. In conclusion, we identified different country-level indicators significantly associated with differences in COVID-19 testing rates among SEA countries. Due to the study's ecological design, we caution on applying our results to the individual level given potential for systematic differences between the included countries. Additional investigation is likewise needed to understand how government expenditure on healthcare may have impacted COVID-19 testing capacity during the initial stages of the pandemic."

37933093,"Navigating the Shifts: Retrospective Analysis of Alcohol Consumption and its Predictors Across Pre-Pandemic, Lockdown, and Post-Pandemic Eras in Poland.","BACKGROUND Alcohol consumption is a serious health risk that affects both physical and mental health. It is one of the major risk factors in the development of non-communicable diseases. The aim of this study was to perform a retrospective analysis of alcohol consumption patterns, determine of predictors of alcohol addiction, and attempt to distinguish and compare the profiles of participants differentiated in terms of their preferences in the pre-pandemic, lockdown, and post-pandemic periods. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study was conducted with a computer-assisted web interview on a representative sample of Polish citizens. Primary outcomes were sociodemographic and COVID-19-related variables, preferences regarding the type and location of consumed alcohol, reasons for drinking, severity of addiction symptoms, loneliness, quality of life, and health level. RESULTS During the lockdown period, the percentage of people declaring abstinence increased, as well as people who, according to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) cut-off points, could be diagnosed with probable alcohol dependence. The strongest predictors of the severity of addiction symptoms were preferences regarding the type and place of alcohol consumption, with a high percentage of explained variance (>50%). The analysis of profiles differentiated in terms of the preferred type of alcohol consumed allowed for the identification of 7 different profiles, which differed in terms of AUDIT score, loneliness, quality of life, and level of health. CONCLUSIONS Patterns of alcohol consumption changed during the pandemic. Alcohol-related preferences are important from the public health perspective."
37932948,"COVID-19 pandemic: Public attitudes and opinions on a global health crisis among residents in Sarawak, Malaysia.","In Sarawak, Malaysia, several exceptional safety precautions and measures were adopted to prevent the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from spreading. Individuals' attitudes and opinions have impact on their obedience toward control procedures. Sarawak residents' attitudes and opinions toward COVID-19 were investigated in the present study. An online questionnaire developed using Google Forms was completed by 1,462 residents from all 12 divisions in Sarawak. The findings show that most Sarawak residents have positive attitudes and opinions about current standard operating procedures (SOPs) toward COVID-19. More than half of the respondents stand unbiased for the effectiveness of these SOPs, while most respondents have a neutral standpoint regarding the current law enforcement. The partial least square regression results found using the WarpPLS 7.0 software indicate that Sarawak residents' attitudes, opinions about current SOPs, and their effectiveness are significantly linked to practices for the prevention of COVID-19 outbreak, whereas these residents' opinions about current law enforcement were observed to have no significant relationship with proper practices for measures."
37932946,Pandemic politics: Exploring the intersection of state political affiliation and public universities' COVID-19 policies and messaging.,"As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread within the United States, the challenge of responding to a large-scale health crisis was compounded as the federal government struggled to deliver a unified response. Decision-making powers for pandemic protocols were passed to individual states, whose responses were heavily influenced by their administrations' partisan political leanings. This study explores differences in the transparency of COVID-19 information on university websites and the restrictiveness of the measures they implemented by examining university messaging in all-Republican and all-Democrat controlled states. This study employs a quantitative content analysis of a census of websites (N = 265) from public universities located in states with government trifectas. The data reveal that masking, vaccination, and testing measures were significantly more restrictive among universities located in Democratic trifectas than in Republican trifectas. Additionally, universities in Democratic trifectas communicated more transparently, such that they were more likely to have a direct link to COVID-19 information on their homepages. The results indicate that universities in states where a single political party holds power implemented COVID-19 protocols that reflected the political -viewpoints on the health and economic responses to the pandemic. This finding offers important evidence that both governments and public universities based their public health decisions on political factors."

Yet a discourse of personal responsibility for mental health often dominates in mental health promotion campaigns, media coverage and lay understandings, contributing to the stigmatisation of mental ill-health."
37932626,Food and Housing Insecurity in Nevada During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic intensified concerns regarding food and housing insecurity in the United States, particularly among vulnerable populations. After the pandemic prompted a shutdown of nonessential businesses in Nevada, unemployment rose dramatically as the gaming, tourism, and hospitality industries struggled. This study analyzed the results of two telephone surveys of Nevada adults' experiences in 2020 (n = 1000) and 2021 (n = 1002). The results demonstrate between 2020 and 2021 an 8.24 percentage point decline in food insecurity (FI) from 30.2% to 21.96% and a 12.58 percentage point increase in housing insecurity (HI) from 12.27% to 24.85%. Age, disability status, and certain categories of race/ethnicity and income were associated with both HI and FI in 2020, but disability was no longer significant in 2021. Instead, spouse/partner-status, living with children ≤ 18-years-old and receipt of SNAP benefits were significantly associated with FI in 2021. In particular, health status became a significant factor of both HI and FI. People of color experienced FI disparities compared to Whites. Asians/Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders were 3.22 times (95% CI 1.51, 6.86) more likely to experience FI in 2021 than Whites. A matched, longitudinal analysis also revealed that Whites experienced a significant 9.1 percentage point estimated decline in the probability of FI between 2020 and 2021. However, the reduction among non-White participants was statistically insignificant at 2.5 percentage points. Results indicate the importance of supporting the food and housing needs of people of color and individuals with disabilities. Further research should especially investigate the comparative FI rate among Asians/Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders in 2021 and offer solutions to the soaring prevalence of housing insecurity."
37932133,"Dimensions of equality in uptake of COVID-19 vaccination in Wales, UK: A multivariable linked data population analysis.","Vaccination has proven to be effective at preventing severe outcomes of COVID-19 infection, and uptake in the population has been high in Wales. However, there is a risk that high-level vaccination coverage statistics may mask hidden inequalities in under-served populations, many of whom may be at increased risk of severe outcomes of COVID-19 infection. The study population included 1,436,229 individuals aged 18 years and over, alive and residence in Wales as at 31st July 2022, and excluded immunosuppressed or care home residents. We compared people who had received one or more vaccinations to those with no vaccination using linked data from nine datasets within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) databank. Multivariable analysis was undertaken to determine the impact of a range of sociodemographic characteristics on vaccination uptake, including ethnicity, country of birth, severe mental illness, homelessness and substance use. We found that overall uptake of first dose of COVID-19 vaccination was high in Wales (92.1 %), with the highest among those aged 80 years and over and females. Those aged under 40 years, household composition (aOR 0.38 95 %CI 0.35-0.41 for 10+ size household compared to two adult household) and being born outside the UK (aOR 0.44 95 %CI 0.43-0.46) had the strongest negative associations with vaccination uptake. This was followed by a history of substance misuse (aOR 0.45 95 %CI 0.44-0.46). Despite high-level population coverage in Wales, significant inequalities remain across several underserved groups. Factors associated with vaccination uptake should not be considered in isolation, to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. Ensuring equitable access to vaccination is essential to protecting under-served groups from COVID-19 and further work needs to be done to address these gaps in coverage, with focus on tailored vaccination pathways and advocacy, using trusted partners and communities."

37930974,Identifying price bubbles in copper market: Evidence from a GSADF test approach.,"This paper uses the test proposed by Generalized Supremum Augmented Dickey-Fuller to identify whether there are multiple bubbles in copper price. The empirical results show that base on market fundamentals, there are seven bubbles existed from January 1980 to March 2023. Through analyses, the first two bubbles can be explained by the demand from Japan by the industry concentration and persistent supply constraint. The third to sixth bubbles are mainly negatively impacted by the global financial crisis and growing demand of China. The last bubble is caused by the economic recovery from Covid-19. The logit regression has stated that aluminum price, copper production, all metals index and GDP have a positive impact on copper bubbles, while China's copper imports and precious metals price negatively explains copper bubbles. The main contributions are the investigation of the copper price bubbles, its determinants and the different technique of GSADF to detect copper price bubbles. Furthermore, it provides helpful information for those investors to make reasonable investment decisions and thus, avoid potential price risk."
37929963,SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 associates with TRiC and the P323L substitution acts as a host adaption.,"SARS-CoV-2 emerged in the human population in late 2019, and human-to-human transmission has dominated the evolutionary landscape and driven the selection of different lineages. The first major change that resulted in increased transmission was the D614G substitution in the spike protein. This was accompanied by the P323L substitution in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NSP12). Together with D614G, these changes are the root of the predominant global SARS-CoV-2 landscape. Here, we found that NSP12 formed an interactome with cellular proteins. The functioning of NSP12 was dependent on the T-complex protein ring complex, a molecular chaperone. In contrast, there was a differential association between NSP12 variants and components of a phosphatase complex (PP2/PP2A and STRN3). The virus expressing NSP12"

However, there is a lack of comprehensive research on the potential adverse health effects of mask usage. This study aimed to investigate and evaluate the negative effects of surgical mask use on scientifically proven cardiopulmonary functions in undergraduate and associate degree students, as well as its impact on coronaphobia. A total of 145 volunteer university students (49 males, 96 females, with a mean age of 20 years) were enrolled in the study, which consisted of two 120-minute sessions. Blood oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure were assessed before and immediately after each session. The Coronavirus-19 Phobia Scale was utilized to measure levels of COVID-19 phobia. While a time-dependent decrease in oxygen saturation level, blood pressure, and heart rate was measured when vital signs were evaluated at 1 and 120 minutes, none of the values fell outside the reference range. The study also investigated the effects of mask use on various symptoms including headaches, visual impairment, facial discomfort, earaches, shortness of breath, and anxiety.

37929068,The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on life expectancy in the USA: An application of hybrid life expectancy.,"Pandemics are, by definition, temporary intervals of substantially increased mortality rates experienced across a wide geographic area. One way of assessing the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA has been to compute the differences in life expectancy at birth during a pandemic year and the year before the pandemic. Such comparisons are misleading because they do not account for the duration of the pandemic. The computation of life expectancy in 2019 assumes that people spend their entire lives experiencing prepandemic mortality rates. The computation of life expectancy in 2021 assumes that people live their entire lives in a permanent pandemic. However, people do not live their entire lives experiencing the elevated mortality rates of 2021. This article introduces a method for calculating life expectancy that reflects the experience of people enduring pandemic-level mortality rates for fixed durations. We call the new quantity "

37928389,Are economic policy uncertainty and carbon futures price interacting? Evidence from the European Union.,"This paper investigates the dynamic interplay between economic policy uncertainty and the carbon futures market within the context of global low-carbon development. The study utilizes a comprehensive dataset spanning 2005 to 2023, including daily observations of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and carbon future prices (EUAP) in the European Union. Bootstrap subsample rolling window Granger causality tests are employed to examine the interrelationship between EPU and EUAP, providing robust and time-varying causal insights. The findings reveal the adverse impact of EPU on EUAP, highlighting that the volatility associated with economic policy uncertainty can serve as a predictive factor for carbon future prices. On the other hand, the EUAP exhibits a negative influence on the uncertainty of economic policy, indicating that the economic situation in Europe can be observed through the carbon future market. The findings presented in this study are in line with the underlying theoretical model of policy uncertainty and future prices. Considering the complex economic environment and the influence exerted by COVID-19, exploring the link between EPU and EUAP is crucial for informing investors' decision-making and guiding the development of policy to enhance carbon market efficiency and promote a low-carbon economy."

We continue to learn more about how healthcare disparities manifest for our patients and, more broadly, the structural underpinnings that result in predictable outcomes gaps. This review summarizes what we know about disparities relevant to interventional radiologists. The prevalence and magnitude of disparities are quantified and discussed where relevant. Specific examples are provided to demonstrate how factors like gender, ethnicity, social status, geography, etc. interact to create inequities in the delivery of interventional radiology (IR) care. Understanding and addressing health disparities in IR is crucial for improving real-world patient outcomes and reducing the economic burden associated with ineffective and low-value care. Finally, the importance of intentional mentorship, outreach, education, and equitable distribution of high-quality healthcare to mitigate these disparities and promote health equity in interventional radiology is discussed."

37926556,Time matters in pandemic risk communication: A moderated effect of information timeliness on stakeholder perception in Singapore.,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic shows the increasing importance of determining the factors of the public perceptions of personal and societal risks. These perceptions can shape people's behaviors, which, in turn, alter the spread of a pandemic on the community level. However, previous research on risk communication was inconsistent, and little is known about the impact of timely warning messages on stakeholders' perceptions of public health emergencies. To address this theoretical gap, this study analyzes the survey data (N = 538) from Singapore to explore the main effect of information timeliness on the respondents' stakeholder perceptions. This effect is moderated by normative factors, including attention and threat perceptions. We find that the more timely the government updates the risk information, the more trustworthy the stakeholders appear in respondents' opinions. Such an effect is weakened when the pre-decision attention or the threat perception interacts with the predictor independently. However, this effect on stakeholder perceptions becomes stronger if both moderators interact with the information timeliness. That is, an appropriate combination of the information released by the government can effectively enhance the image of the stakeholders during the pandemic."

Yet, it is unclear to what degree journalists use open research outputs in their reporting, what factors motivate or constrain this use, and how the recent surge in openly available research seen during the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the relationship between open science and science journalism. This literature review thus examines journalists' use of open research outputs, specifically open access publications and preprints. We focus on literature published from 2018 onwards-particularly literature relating to the COVID-19 pandemic-but also include seminal articles outside the search dates. We find that, despite journalists' potential to act as critical brokers of open access knowledge, their use of open research outputs is hampered by an overreliance on traditional criteria for evaluating scientific quality; concerns about the trustworthiness of open research outputs; and challenges using and verifying the findings. We also find that, while the COVID-19 pandemic encouraged journalists to explore open research outputs such as preprints, the extent to which these explorations will become established journalistic practices remains unclear. Furthermore, we note that current research is overwhelmingly authored and focused on the Global North, and the United States specifically. Finally, given the dearth of research in this area, we conclude with recommendations for future research that attend to issues of equity and diversity, and more explicitly examine the intersections of open science and science journalism."
37919737,The impact of geo-political socio-economic factors on vaccine dissemination trends: a case-study on COVID-19 vaccination strategies.,"The world in recent years has seen a pandemic of global scale. To counter the widespread loss of life and severe repercussions, researchers developed vaccinations at a fast pace to immunize the population. While the vaccines were developed and tested through extensive human trials, historically vaccines have been known to evoke mixed sentiments among the generic demographics. In the proposed study, we aim to reveal the impact of political and socio-economic factors on SARS-Cov-2 vaccination trends observed in two hundred and seventeen countries spread across the six continents."
37919694,"Effectiveness of a scalable, remotely delivered stepped-care intervention to reduce symptoms of psychological distress among Polish migrant workers in the Netherlands: study protocol for the RESPOND randomised controlled trial.","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of international migrant workers (IMWs). IMWs experience multiple barriers to accessing mental health care. Two scalable interventions developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) were adapted to address some of these barriers: Doing What Matters in times of stress (DWM), a guided self-help web application, and Problem Management Plus (PM +), a brief facilitator-led program to enhance coping skills. This study examines whether DWM and PM + remotely delivered as a stepped-care programme (DWM/PM +) is effective and cost-effective in reducing psychological distress, among Polish migrant workers with psychological distress living in the Netherlands."

37918226,Return-to-work with long COVID: An Episodic Disability and Total Worker Health® analysis.,"A growing number of working individuals have developed long COVID (LC) after COVID-19 infection. Economic analyses indicate that workers' LC symptoms contribute to workforce shortages. However, factors that affect return-to-work from perspectives of people with LC remain largely underexplored. This qualitative study of people with LC conducted by researchers living with LC aimed to identify participants' return-to-work experiences using Total Worker Health® and Episodic Disability frameworks. 10% of participants who participated in a mixed-method global internet survey, had LC symptoms >3 months, and responded in English were randomly selected for thematic analysis using NVivo12. 15% of responses were independently double-coded to identify coding discrepancies. Participants (N = 510) were predominately white and had at least a baccalaureate degree. Four primary work-related themes emerged: 1) strong desire and need to return to work motivated by sense of purpose and financial precarity; 2) diverse and episodic LC symptoms intersect with organization of work and home life; 3) pervasiveness of LC disbelief and stigma at work and in medical settings; and 4) support of medical providers is key to successful return-to-work. Participants described how fluctuation of symptoms, exacerbated by work-related tasks, made returning to work challenging. Participants' ability to work was often predicated on job accommodations and support. Non-work factors were also essential, especially being able to receive an LC medical diagnosis (key to accessing leave and accommodations) and help at home to manage non-work activities. Many participants described barriers accessing these supports, illuminating stigma and disbelief in LC as a medical condition. Qualitative findings indicate needs for workplace accommodations tailored to fluctuating symptoms, continuously re-evaluated by workers and supervisors together. Reductions in medical barriers to access work accommodations is also critical since many medical providers remain unaware of LC, and workers may lack a positive COVID test result."

People on anti-retro viral drugs (ART) were at risk for discontinuation of medications during corona viral disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 outbreak made people living with HIV (PLWH) to experience critical challenges and barriers to optimal care. The experience of people living with HIV such as stigma and discrimination, economic problem, psychosocial problem before the emergency of COVID-19 were studied but there is lack of understanding on the lived experience of people living with HIV in the context of COVID-19 in Ethiopia particularly in Tach Gayint. This study aimed to explore the lived experience of people on ART in context of COVID-19 in Tach Gayint district."
37917650,The impact of national income and vaccine hesitancy on country-level COVID-19 vaccine uptake.,"The rapid development and rollout of COVID-19 vaccines helped reduce the pandemic's mortality burden. The vaccine rollout, however, has been uneven; it is well known that vaccination rates tend to be lower in lower income countries. Vaccine uptake, however, ultimately depends on the willingness of individuals to get vaccinated. If vaccine confidence is low, then uptake will be low, regardless of country income level. We investigated the impact on country-level COVID-19 vaccination rates of both national income and vaccine hesitancy."
37917610,Long COVID in the United States.,"Although yet to be clearly identified as a clinical condition, there is immense concern at the health and wellbeing consequences of long COVID. Using data collected from nearly half a million Americans in the period June 2022-December 2022 in the US Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey (HPS), we find 14 percent reported suffering long COVID at some point, half of whom reported it at the time of the survey. Its incidence varies markedly across the United States-from 11 percent in Hawaii to 18 percent in West Virginia-and is higher for women than men, among Whites compared with Blacks and Asians, and declines with rising education and income. It is at its highest in midlife in the same way as negative affect. Ever having had long COVID is strongly associated with negative affect (anxiety, depression, worry and a lack of interest in things), with the correlation being strongest among those who currently report long COVID, especially if they report severe symptoms. In contrast, those who report having had short COVID report higher wellbeing than those who report never having had COVID. Long COVID is also strongly associated with physical mobility problems, and with problems dressing and bathing. It is also associated with mental problems as indicated by recall and understanding difficulties. Again, the associations are strongest among those who currently report long COVID, while those who said they had had short COVID have fewer physical and mental problems than those who report never having had COVID. Vaccination is associated with lower negative affect, including among those who reported having had long COVID."
37917493,Convergence of collaborative behavior in virtual teams: The role of external crises and implications for performance.,"Organizations have increasingly relied on virtual teams (VTs). For VTs to succeed, the collaborative behavior of team members plays an important role. Drawing from the open systems theory and using a phenomenon-driven approach, we investigate the dynamic pattern of collaborative behavior convergence among members of VTs (i.e., the emergence of collaborative behavior consensus) and its relationship with VT performance. Moreover, we investigate the differential influence of external crises, exemplified by key dynamic facets of the COVID-19 crisis (i.e., COVID-19 health threat and social distance). We used a multilevel approach (i.e., time, individual, and team levels) with the multilevel group-process framework to test our hypotheses. Results from a survey of 3,506 participants nested in 703 teams suggest that collaborative behaviors of VT members tend to converge over time, leading to the emergence of collaborative behavior consensus. Furthermore, a dynamic COVID-19 health threat leads to lower collaborative behavior consensus over time. Moreover, our results show that collaborative behavior consensus is partially positively related to VT performance and is particularly important for VTs with a lower level of collaborative behavior at the end of the collaboration. The practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)."

37916185,The impact of COVID-19 on physical and mental health: A longitudinal study.,"In this paper, we exploit variation in COVID-19 infections and deaths across Chinese cities to identify the health impacts of COVID-19 based on longitudinal data at the individual level. Our paper provides empirical evidence of the immediate impact of COVID-19 on both physical and mental health. Utilizing a difference-in-differences methodology and focusing on changes in within-individual health condition between pre-COVID-19 and the early stages of COVID-19, we find robust evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic has an adverse effect on self-perceived health condition, chronic illness, sleep, and depression. Our findings are robust to alternative constructions of cities' exposure to COVID-19, to the exclusion of Wuhan city, which was hit the hardest and had experienced the most stringent lockdowns. Furthermore, accounting for the impact of COVID-19 policies, our results indicate that the decline in physical health can be attributed to the shock of the pandemic, while emotional health is mainly affected by anti-contagion policies."
37916078,COVID-19 pandemic and financial market volatility: A quantile regression approach.,"The study examined the nexus between the COVID-19 pandemic and the market volatility of the global markets. For this purpose, a 30-country sample was used based on the most COVID-19 cases and deaths during the study period, from January 1 to December 12, 2020. We employed panel quantile regression and Panel Estimated Generalized Least Square (Panel-EGLS) frameworks to analyze the influence of COVID-19 on volatility in the whole sample and subsamples of emerging and developed markets. Our results of Panel-EGLS showed that the new cases and deaths positively impact volatility in the naïve and control models. The results from quantile regression also illustrated that new deaths and cases have positively influenced market volatility at the 50th and 75th quantiles. From the subsamples, our results demonstrate almost similar signs and significance for the impact of COVID-19 on market volatility in developed and emerging markets in both the naïve and control models. Both the results illustrate that any increase in COVID-19 positively caused volatility in the whole and subsamples at the mean and upper quantile levels. Our results necessitate coordinated global government actions to stabilize markets, mitigate volatility's impact by proactive policies in future health crises, and underscore a monetary policy for stability."
37915849,Immunoinformatic exploration of a multi-epitope-based peptide vaccine candidate targeting emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2.,"Many countries around the world are facing severe challenges due to the recently emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. Over the last few months, scientists have been developing treatments, drugs, and vaccines to subdue the virus and prevent its transmission. In this context, a peptide-based vaccine construct containing pathogenic proteins of the virus known to elicit an immune response was constructed. An analysis of the spike protein-based epitopes allowed us to design an ""epitope-based subunit vaccine"" against coronavirus using the approaches of ""reverse vaccinology"" and ""immunoinformatics."" Computational experimentation and a systematic, comprehensive protocol were followed with an aim to develop and design a multi-epitope-based peptide (MEBP) vaccine candidate. Our study attempted to predict an MEBP vaccine by introducing mutations of SARS-CoV-2 (Delta, Lambda, Iota, Omicron, and Kappa) in Spike glycoprotein and predicting dual-purpose epitopes (B-cell and T-cell). This was followed by screening the selected epitopes based on antigenicity, allergenicity, and population coverage and constructing them into a vaccine by using linkers and adjuvants. The vaccine construct was analyzed for its physicochemical properties and secondary structure prediction, and a 3D structure was built, refined, and validated. Furthermore, the peptide-protein interaction of the vaccine construct with Toll-like receptor (TLR) molecules was performed. Immune profiling was performed to check the immune response. Codon optimization of the vaccine construct was performed to obtain the GC content before cloning it into the "
37915162,Monoclonal Antibodies for COVID-19 Treatment: Is It an Option in Indonesia?,"More than three years after Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2), was declared pandemic by World Health Organization, report of COVID-19 hospitalization and death have been decreasing. Even though COVID-19 as global health emergency has been declared end, research in finding and evaluating modalities that can decrease severity and mortality from COVID-19 infection are still on going.Until now, there have been more than 380,000 publications in Pubmed with search term ""COVID 19"". Excessive inflammatory activation is an important part of COVID-19 pathogenesis which can be caused by interactions of the virus with the host and modulation of host immune response.2 Better understanding on COVID-19 pathogenesis could improve the strategies to manage COVID-19 infection.  Monoclonal antibody is one treatment modality that can be used to target the virus itself or modulate dysregulated immune response in COVID-19.  Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can halt progression of COVID-19 in high-risk patients. However, considering the limited production and high cost, is this treatment modality an option in Indonesia?Many things have been learned from this pandemic and can be a lesson for preparing the next pandemic or other emerging diseases. Various therapeutic developments to treat COVID-19 have been studied for hospitalized patients and outpatient setting, one of which is the use of variety monoclonal antibodies that showed overall moderate efficacy in decreasing severity and mortality from COVID-19 infection and also good safety. Unfortunately, besides variable efficacy across variants, the cost for monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are still high which make the access for this treatment options for managing COVID-19 might be limited in low to middle income countries. Feasibility and economical sustainability of mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 seem to be optimal in localized epidemics or small outbreaks."

37910463,The evolving Lebanese drug crisis: Trends in drug availability and affordability for common outpatient diseases from 2019 to 2023.,"Since 2019, Lebanon has been suffering from an enduring economic crisis, that in conjunction with the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Beirut Port Explosion, has had catastrophic consequences on many facets of the Lebanese healthcare system. However, few studies have operationalized the impact of the crisis on drug availability and affordability. This is particularly relevant given that Lebanon imports approximately 95% of pharmaceutical products. Toward this end, we evaluated trends in outpatient drug availability and affordability in the context of monthly mean income at three time points throughout the evolving economic crisis (pre-crisis-August 2019, early crisis- August 2021, most recent-April 2023). Drugs used to treat the most common causes of mortality in Lebanon were selected from the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health (MOPH)'s List of Essential Medications. Drug pricing was obtained from the Lebanese MOPH National Drug Database. We found large increases in drug prices, as a percentage of mean monthly income, after subsidies on chronic disease medications were removed. Diabetes and COPD drugs were the least affordable in 2023, amounting to 21.03% and 15.43% of mean monthly income, respectively. We also highlight great shortages in drugs across classes, particularly in mood-stabilizing psychiatric drugs and basal and bolus insulin. Our findings highlight the growing financial burden of chronic disease treatment in Lebanon and the importance of implementing both short- and long-term solutions to mitigate the impact of the crisis on public health."

37907531,The unseen toll: excess mortality during covid-19 lockdowns.,"In March 2020, in an attempt to slow the spread of Covid-19, several countries intervened by imposing strict lockdown measures that limited contact among people. In contrast, Sweden decided to not implement a mandatory lockdown and instead allowed people free choice on whether or not to follow the government recommendation to limit contact with others. Using the Synthetic Control Method, we estimate the causal effect of not implementing a mandatory lockdown in Sweden in the period from the end of February 2020 to the end of September 2020, a time when vaccines were as yet not available. We find that not imposing a mandatory lockdown resulted in a lower reduction of mobility and a substantial increase in mortality. Our results indicates that up to about 4411 of the 46554 deaths registered in Sweden during this period could have been avoided had Sweden implemented a mandatory lockdown. These results remain consistent when using two additional state-of-the-art estimation methods; the augmented synthetic control method and synthetic difference-in-difference."

37907058,"Spatial patterns of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 mortality across waves of infection in England, Wales, and Scotland.","Recent studies have established the key individual-level risk factors of COVID-19 mortality such as age, gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status. However, the spread of infectious diseases is a spatial and temporal process implying that COVID-19 mortality and its determinants may vary sub-nationally and over time. We investigate the spatial patterns of age-standardised death rates due to COVID-19 and their correlates across local authority districts in England, Wales, and Scotland across three waves of infection. Using a Spatial Durbin model, we explore within- and between-country variation and account for spatial dependency. Areas with a higher share of ethnic minorities and higher levels of deprivation had higher rates of COVID-19 mortality. However, the share of ethnic minorities and population density in an area were more important predictors of COVID-19 mortality in earlier waves of the pandemic than in later waves, whereas area-level deprivation has become a more important predictor over time. Second, during the first wave of the pandemic, population density had a significant spillover effect on COVID-19 mortality, indicating that the pandemic spread from big cities to neighbouring areas. Third, after accounting for differences in ethnic composition, deprivation, and population density, initial cross-country differences in COVID-19 mortality almost disappeared. COVID-19 mortality remained higher in Scotland than in England and Wales in the third wave when COVID-19 mortality was relatively low in all three countries. Interpreting these results in the context of higher overall (long-term) non-COVID-19 mortality in Scotland suggests that Scotland may have performed better than expected during the first two waves. Our study highlights that accounting for both spatial and temporal factors is essential for understanding social and demographic risk factors of mortality during pandemics."

It is in this scenario that the political, economic and health crisis occurred, with the social outbreak in 2019 and then the COVID-19 pandemic. The mortality of children and adolescents dropped significantly, however, changes in lifestyles and demotivation, associated with long confinement and worsening health of parents and caregivers triggered an epidemic of mental health, developmental and nutritional problems. Pediatricians were forced to reinvent themselves, exposing themselves to stress and burnout. The aim of the manuscript is to describe the demographic, epidemiological and public policy context of child health in Chile in the last century, as a backdrop to dimension the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The new health challenges for this age group in the medium and long term are discussed. Some theories, conceptualizations, and relevant milestones of the public health system in Chile are presented. The emergence of ""post-pandemic morbidity"", such as sedentary lifestyle, food insecurity, screen addiction, identity conflicts, violence, mental health disorders and reemergence of morbidity and mortality due to infectious and contagious diseases is discussed. Professionals responsible for the care of children must redouble their efforts to provide comprehensive care, accompanying families in the new challenges, in order to rehabilitate a healthy childhood."

37903875,Antibody response and soluble mediator profile in the first six months following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a severe global health and economic crisis, with significant consequences for human mortality and morbidity. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, both to enhance its effectiveness and prevent its deleterious effects. This study presents the chronology of antibodies during six months after infection in hospitalized patients and the kinetics of serum soluble mediators of the cellular response triggered by SARS-CoV-2. Samples and clinical data from 330 patients hospitalized at the Hospital da Baleia in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, who were suspected of having COVID-19, were collected at the time of hospitalization and during 6 months after infection. The immune response was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry. There was a significant difference in IgM specific antibody titers from the 7th to 60th days after infection between COVID-19 negative and positive patients. Soon after 60 days after infection, antibody levels started to reduce, becoming similar to the antibody levels of the COVID-19 negative patients. IgG specific antibodies started to be detectable after 9 days of infection and antibody levels were comparatively higher in positive patients as soon as after 7 days. Furthermore, IgG levels remained higher in these patients during the complete period of 180 days after infection. The study observed similar antibody profiles between different patient groups. The soluble systemic biomarkers evaluated showed a decrease during the six months after hospitalization, except for CCL11, CXCL8, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, IL-6, IFN-g, IL-17, IL-5, FGF-basic, PDGF, VEGF, G-CSF, and GM-CSF. The results indicate that IgM antibodies are more prominent in the early stages of infection, while IgG antibodies persist for a longer period. Additionally, the study identified that patients with COVID-19 have elevated levels of biomarkers after symptom onset, which decrease over time."
37903813,"The full health, economic, and social benefits of prospective Strep A vaccination.","Recent research has documented a wide range of health, economic, and social benefits conferred by vaccination, beyond the direct reductions in morbidity, mortality, and future healthcare costs traditionally captured in economic evaluations. In this paper, we describe the societal benefits that would likely stem from widespread administration of safe and effective vaccines against Streptococcus pyogenes (Strep A), which was estimated to be the fifth-leading cause of infectious disease deaths globally prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. We then estimate the global societal gains from prospective Strep A vaccination through a value-per-statistical-life approach. Estimated aggregate lifetime benefits for 30 global birth cohorts range from $1.7 to $5.1 trillion, depending on the age at which vaccination is administered and other factors. These results suggest that the benefits of Strep A vaccination would be large and justify substantial investment in the vaccines' development, manufacture, and delivery."

Using Internet search data, I found that nationwide search intensity for learning resources surged when schools were closed, and such search behaviors remained after schools reopened. I also found that high socioeconomic status households had better access to school- and parent-centered resources, and online tutoring resources, even after schools reopened. Given its persistent impact on learning, the pandemic will likely widen educational inequality over extended periods."
37902902,"Impact of Language Barriers on Outcomes and Experience of COVID-19 Patients Hospitalized in Quebec, Canada, During the First Wave of the Pandemic.","Language barriers (LB) contribute to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health inequities. People with LB were more likely to be SARS-CoV-2 positive despite lower testing and had higher rates of hospitalization. Data on hospital outcomes among immigrants with LB, however, are limited. We aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 cases by LB, immigration status, ethnicity, and access to COVID-19 health information and services prior to admission. Adults with laboratory-confirmed community-acquired COVID-19 hospitalized from March 1 to June 30, 2020, at four tertiary-care hospitals in Montréal, Quebec, Canada were included. Demographics, comorbidities, immigration status, country of birth, ethnicity, presence of LB, and hospital outcomes (ICU admission and death) were obtained through a chart review. Additional socio-economic and access to care questions were obtained through a phone survey. A Fine-Gray competing risk subdistribution hazards model was used to estimate the risk of ICU admission and in-hospital death by immigrant status, region of birth and LB Among 1093 patients, 622 (56.9%) were immigrants and 101 (16.2%) of them had a LB. One third (36%) of immigrants with LB did not have access to an interpreter during hospitalization. Admission to ICU and in-hospital mortality were not significantly different between groups. Prior to admission, one third (14/41) of immigrants with LB had difficulties accessing COVID-19 information in their mother tongue and one third (9/27) of non-white immigrants with a LB had difficulties accessing COVID-19 services. Immigrants with LB were inequitably affected by the first wave of the pandemic in Quebec, Canada. In our study, a large proportion had difficulties accessing information and services related to COVID-19 prior to admission, which may have increased SARS-CoV-2 exposure and hospitalizations. After hospitalization, a large proportion did not have access to interpreters. Providing medical information and care in the language of preference of increasing diverse populations in Canada is important for promoting health equity."

37898999,"Public health restrictions, directives, and measures in Arctic countries in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Beginning January of 2020, COVID-19 cases detected in Arctic countries triggered government policy responses to stop transmission and limit caseloads beneath levels that would overwhelm existing healthcare systems. This review details the various restrictions, health mandates, and transmission mitigation strategies imposed by governments in eight Arctic countries (the United States, Canada, Greenland, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, and Russia) during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, through 31 January 2021s31 January 2021. We highlight formal protocols and informal initiatives adopted by local communities in each country, beyond what was mandated by regional or national governments. This review documents travel restrictions, communications, testing strategies, and use of health technology to track and monitor COVID-19 cases. We provide geographical and sociocultural background and draw on local media and communications to contextualise the impact of COVID-19 emergence and prevention measures in Indigenous communities in the Arctic. Countries saw varied case rates associated with local protocols, governance, and population. Still, almost all regions maintained low COVID-19 case rates until November of 2020. This review was produced as part of an international collaboration to identify community-driven, evidence-based promising practices and recommendations to inform pan-Arctic collaboration and decision making in public health during global emergencies."
37898881,[The characteristics and problems of professional activity of medical workers in conditions of COVID-19 pandemic].,"The article is based on the results of sociological survey of medical workers of the Republic of Bashkortostan in 2021. The approaches to issues of their professional activities are analyzed. It is argued that the COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated a number of systemic problems accumulated in health care system in last years. The main difficulties are associated with shortage of medical personnel, increased workload, low remuneration of labor of medical workers, unpractical work organization decreasing quality of medical care, etc. The majority of respondents (68.4%) are not satisfied with their salaries. The highest percentage of negative assessments is fixed among physicians and paramedical personnel. The amount of average monthly salary of junior medical personnel is so low that it does not correlate with the minimum wage accepted in the Republic. The study discovered sufficiently high occupational risk, determined by biological production factor related to possibility COVID-19 contamination. The assessment of occupational morbidity demonstrated that at present the most widely-spread occupational pathologies in medical workers are infection with COVID-19 (70.2%) and emotional burnout syndrome (67.2%). Such measures as annual dispensarization, provision of medical workers with sanatorium-and-spa vouchers are obviously insufficient. Only 14.1% of respondents could underwent annual medical examination. Only 13.8% of respondents had opportunity to take advantage of sanatorium-and-spa vouchers. The study revealed deficiency of personnel in medical organizations among paramedical and junior medical personnel and physicians as well."

Corresponding consequences on persons with chronic diseases remain insufficiently documented. This observational cohort study investigated the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic period on the survival of kidney transplant recipients (KTR). Using the French National Health Data System, incident persons with end-stage kidney disease between 2015 and 2020, and who received a kidney transplant during this period were included and followed up from their transplantation date to December 31, 2021. The survival of KTR during the prepandemic and pandemic periods was investigated using Cox models with time-dependent covariates. There were 10 637 KTR included in the study, with 324 and 430 deaths observed during the prepandemic and pandemic periods, respectively. The adjusted risk of death during the pandemic period was similar to that observed during the prepandemic period (hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval]: 0.92 [0.77-1.11]), COVID-19-related hospitalization was associated with an increased risk of death (HR: 10.62 [8.46-13.33]), and a third vaccine dose was associated with a lower risk of death (HR: 0.42 [0.30-0.57]). The pandemic period was not associated with an indirect higher risk of death in KTR with no COVID-19-related hospitalization."

37897356,"COV2Var, a function annotation database of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variation.","The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in the loss of millions of lives and severe global economic consequences. Every time SARS-CoV-2 replicates, the viruses acquire new mutations in their genomes. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes led to increased transmissibility, severe disease outcomes, evasion of the immune response, changes in clinical manifestations and reducing the efficacy of vaccines or treatments. To date, the multiple resources provide lists of detected mutations without key functional annotations. There is a lack of research examining the relationship between mutations and various factors such as disease severity, pathogenicity, patient age, patient gender, cross-species transmission, viral immune escape, immune response level, viral transmission capability, viral evolution, host adaptability, viral protein structure, viral protein function, viral protein stability and concurrent mutations. Deep understanding the relationship between mutation sites and these factors is crucial for advancing our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and for developing effective responses. To fill this gap, we built COV2Var, a function annotation database of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variation, available at http://biomedbdc.wchscu.cn/COV2Var/. COV2Var aims to identify common mutations in SARS-CoV-2 variants and assess their effects, providing a valuable resource for intensive functional annotations of common mutations among SARS-CoV-2 variants."
37897021,Evaluation of the Organisation of the COVID-19 Vaccination Process by the Teachers in a Region of Poland.,"The aim of this study was to assess the organisational process of vaccination within the National Vaccination Programme against COVID-19 (NVP) in the professional group of teachers in Pomeranian Province, Poland. The main goal of the survey was to assess the quality of planning and executing of the NVP and to find a correlation between social and employment placements with the level of perception of chosen quality indicators of the NVP. The presented cross-sectional survey was conducted among 4622 teachers from all levels of education in public and non-public institutions who received the SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccination campaign with the vaccine from AstraZeneca as part of the NVP. The survey was conducted using an original, self-designed questionnaire prepared for this study and distributed to teachers in the form of an online survey via email. Bayesian logistic and linear regression were used to estimate the relationship between predictors and dependent variables. Age was the main factor associated with the performance assessment of the vaccination centre (log[BF] = 0.86-16.88), while gender was the main factor associated with the assessment of NVP (log[BF] = 3.15-10,6). The evaluation of the vaccination registration process (log[BF] = -7.01-50.26) and the evaluation of the information received on the management of post-vaccination reactions (log[BF] = -2.22-65.26) were significant parts of the NVP. It is crucial to tailor information messages to the age and gender of the recipients and to ensure the quality of the information provided by medical personnel, in particular the possible occurrence of vaccination reactions and how to deal with them."
37896949,Immunogenicity and Pre-Clinical Efficacy of an OMV-Based SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine.,"The vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 relies on the world-wide availability of effective vaccines, with a potential need of 20 billion vaccine doses to fully vaccinate the world population. To reach this goal, the manufacturing and logistic processes should be affordable to all countries, irrespective of economical and climatic conditions. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are bacterial-derived vesicles that can be engineered to incorporate heterologous antigens. Given the inherent adjuvanticity, such modified OMVs can be used as vaccines to induce potent immune responses against the associated proteins. Here, we show that OMVs engineered to incorporate peptides derived from the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 elicit an effective immune response in vaccinated mice, resulting in the production of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) with a titre higher than 1:300. The immunity induced by the vaccine is sufficient to protect the animals from intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2, preventing both virus replication in the lungs and the pathology associated with virus infection. Furthermore, we show that OMVs can be effectively decorated with the RBM of the Omicron BA.1 variant and that such engineered OMVs induce nAbs against Omicron BA.1 and BA.5, as measured using the pseudovirus neutralization infectivity assay. Importantly, we show that the RBM"

37895950,Anti-Viral Activity of Bioactive Molecules of Silymarin against COVID-19 via In Silico Studies.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection drove the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, causing a huge loss of human life and a negative impact on economic development. It is an urgent necessity to explore potential drugs against viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. Silymarin, a mixture of herb-derived polyphenolic flavonoids extracted from the milk thistle, possesses potent antioxidative, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Accumulating research studies have demonstrated the killing activity of silymarin against viruses, such as dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and hepatitis C virus. However, the anti-COVID-19 mechanisms of silymarin remain unclear. In this study, multiple disciplinary approaches and methodologies were applied to evaluate the potential mechanisms of silymarin as an anti-viral agent against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In silico approaches such as molecular docking, network pharmacology, and bioinformatic methods were incorporated to assess the ligand-protein binding properties and analyze the protein-protein interaction network. The DAVID database was used to analyze gene functions, such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment. TCMSP and GeneCards were used to identify drug target genes and COVID-19-related genes. Our results revealed that silymarin compounds, such as silybin A/B and silymonin, displayed triplicate functions against SARS-CoV-2 infection, including directly binding with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells, directly binding with viral proteins RdRp and helicase to inhibit viral replication and proliferation, and regulating host immune response to indirectly inhibit viral infection. Specifically, the targets of silymarin molecules in immune regulation were screened out, such as proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 and cell growth factors VEGFA and EGF. In addition, the molecular mechanism of drug-target protein interaction was investigated, including the binding pockets of drug molecules in human ACE2 and viral proteins, the formation of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and other drug-protein ligand interactions. Finally, the drug-likeness results of candidate molecules passed the criteria for drug screening. Overall, this study demonstrates the molecular mechanism of silymarin molecules against SARS-CoV-2 infection."

This survey-based study examined differences in patient-reported COVID-19 symptoms, Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) among groups of patients defined based on age and symptom-based long COVID status. Symptomatic, COVID-19-positive US outpatients were recruited from 31 January-30 April 2022. Outcomes were collected via validated instruments at pre-COVID, Day 3, Week 1, Week 4, Month 3 and Month 6 following infection, with changes assessed from pre-COVID and between groups, adjusting for covariates. EQ-5D-5L HRQoL and WPAI scores declined in all groups, especially during the first week. Long COVID patients reported significantly higher symptoms burden and larger drops in HRQoL and WPAI scores than patients without long COVID. Their HRQoL and WPAI scores did not return to levels comparable to pre-COVID through Month 6, except for absenteeism. Patients without long COVID generally recovered between Week 4 and Month 3. Older (>50) and younger adults generally reported comparable symptoms burden and drops in HRQoL and WPAI scores. During the first week of infection, COVID-19-related health issues caused loss of 14 to 26 work hours across the groups. These data further knowledge regarding the differential impacts of COVID-19 on clinically relevant patient groups."

This study aims to analyze the social determinants of health among migrants and their associated factors and compare the socio-demographic characteristics, patterns of COVID-19, and healthcare attendance and utilization among migrant workers and non-migrants. A descriptive study design was used to analyze COVID-19 morbidity among migrant workers. There were a total of 73,762 migrants living in the province by December 2021, with varied statuses and nationalities. Most of the migrants were from Myanmar, constituting about 80.1%. A total of 24,837 COVID-19 cases in Kanchanaburi province were recorded in 2020-2021. COVID-19 cases among migrant workers accounted for 22.3% during the period under review. Half, 2914 (52.7%) of the migrant female workers were victims of COVID-19 infections. Persons under the age of 18 accounted for about one-fifth of all the COVID-19 cases. Older, over 60 years old, Thais had about twice (10.1%) the COVID-19 cases compared with the older migrants (5.5%). There was a significant increase in healthcare attendance and utilization by non-migrants and migrants during the year under review. Migrants are at high risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, public health guidance for the prevention of COVID-19 should prioritize safeguarding the health of migrants by considering their individual characteristics and actions. Enhancing health insurance schemes for migrants, particularly vulnerable migrant groups, is critical for inclusive and expanded healthcare access. Physical, social, and economic environments that impact the health and well-being of migrants should be integral to pandemic prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery."

Iran is one of the countries with the most deaths in the world (146,321 total deaths; 5 September 2023) and ranks first among the countries of the Middle East and the EMRO. Analysis of confirmed COVID-19 patients' hospital length of stay in Ilam Province can be informative for decision making in other provinces of Iran. This study was conducted to analyze the survival of COVID-19 patients and the factors associated with COVID-19 deaths in the hospitals of Ilam Province. This is a retrospective cross-sectional study. Data from confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ilam Province were obtained from the SIB system in 2019. The sample size was 774 COVID-19-positive patients from Ilam Province. Measuring survival and risk probabilities in one-week intervals was performed using Cox regression. Most patients were male (55.4%) and 55.3% were over 45 years old. Of the 774 patients, 87 (11.2%) died during the study period. The mean hospital length of stay was 5.14 days. The median survival time with a 95% confidence interval was four days.

37889878,The impact of COVID-19 on health financing in Kenya.,"Sudden shocks to health systems, such as the COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt health system functions. Health system functions may also influence the health system's ability to deliver in the face of sudden shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the impact of COVID-19 on the health financing function in Kenya, and how specific health financing arrangements influenced the health systems capacity to deliver services during the COVID-19 pandemic.We conducted a cross-sectional study in three purposively selected counties in Kenya using a qualitative approach. We collected data using in-depth interviews (n = 56) and relevant document reviews. We interviewed national level health financing stakeholders, county department of health managers, health facility managers and COVID-19 healthcare workers. We analysed data using a framework approach. Purchasing arrangements: COVID-19 services were partially subsidized by the national government, exposing individuals to out-of-pocket costs given the high costs of these services. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) adapted its enhanced scheme's benefit package targeting formal sector groups to include COVID-19 services but did not make any adaptations to its general scheme targeting the less well-off in society. This had potential equity implications. Public Finance Management (PFM) systems: Nationally, PFM processes were adaptable and partly flexible allowing shorter timelines for budget and procurement processes. At county level, PFM systems were partially flexible with some resource reallocation but maintained centralized purchasing arrangements. The flow of funds to counties and health facilities was delayed and the procurement processes were lengthy. Reproductive and child health services: Domestic and donor funds were reallocated towards the pandemic response resulting in postponement of program activities and affected family planning service delivery. Universal Health Coverage (UHC) plans: Prioritization of UHC related activities was negatively impacted due the shift of focus to the pandemic response. Contrarily the strategic investments in the health sector were found to be a beneficial approach in strengthening the health system. Strengthening health systems to improve their resilience to cope with public health emergencies requires substantial investment of financial and non-financial resources. Health financing arrangements are integral in determining the extent of adaptability, flexibility, and responsiveness of health system to COVID-19 and future pandemics."

37889410,Post-COVID-19's impact on green supply chain management and sustainable E-commerce performance: the moderating role of big data analytics.,"This study investigates the relationship between COVID-19 and the adoption of green supply chain management practices (GSCM) in the Pakistani e-commerce industry. It also assesses the impact of these practices on ecological sustainability across three dimensions and explores the role of big data analytics (BDA) in enhancing them after the pandemic. The research utilized partial least squares structural equation modeling to evaluate data and test hypotheses. The research sample was composed of 390 managers operating within Pakistan's e-commerce industry. The study's preliminary findings reveal that COVID-19 has positively influenced the adoption of GSCM practices, which are moderated by BDA. Implementing GSCM has a positive impact on the perceived environmental and social resilience of e-commerce enterprises, but no significant effect on their perceived economic resilience. Additionally, GSCM acts as a mediator in the relationship between the impact of COVID-19 and the perceived environmental and social resilience of e-commerce firms, but not for economic resilience. This research focuses on Pakistan's e-commerce industry and investigates how COVID-19 affects the adoption of eco-friendly supply chain practices. It measures the impact of these practices on ecological sustainability using three dimensions. The study also examines how BDA can improve the adoption of GSCM in e-commerce, offering new insights into sustainability during and post-pandemic. The results recommend that the e-commerce industry can use BDA and GSCM practices to improve e-commerce sustainable performance. This is initial research that integrates COVID-19 impact, BDA, GSCM practices, and e-commerce sustainability in a single framework that was overlooked previously."
37888561,Emergent Molecular Techniques Applied to the Detection of Porcine Viruses.,"Molecular diagnostic tests have evolved very rapidly in the field of human health, especially with the arrival of the recent pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, the animal sector is constantly neglected, even though accurate detection by molecular tools could represent economic advantages by preventing the spread of viruses. In this regard, the swine industry is of great interest. The main viruses that affect the swine industry are described in this review, including African swine fever virus (ASFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and porcine circovirus (PCV), which have been effectively detected by different molecular tools in recent times. Here, we describe the rationale of molecular techniques such as multiplex PCR, isothermal methods (LAMP, NASBA, RPA, and PSR) and novel methods such as CRISPR-Cas and microfluidics platforms. Successful molecular diagnostic developments are presented by highlighting their most important findings. Finally, we describe the barriers that hinder the large-scale development of affordable, accessible, rapid, and easy-to-use molecular diagnostic tests. The evolution of diagnostic techniques is critical to prevent the spread of viruses and the development of viral reservoirs in the swine industry that impact the possible development of future pandemics and the world economy."

Given concerns about the unintended consequence of these events, this study protocol will examine how organizations responded to these policies and whether there were changes in SNF and HHA access, care delivery, and outcomes from the perspectives of leadership, staff, patients, and families. We will conduct a two-phase multiple case study guided by the Institute of Medicine's Model of Healthcare Systems. Phase I will include three cases for each setting and a maximum of fifty administrators per case. Phase II will include a subset of Phase I organizations, which are grouped into three setting-specific cases. Each Phase II case will include a maximum of four organizations. Semi-structured interviews will explore the perspectives of frontline staff, patients, and family caregivers (Phase II). Thematic analysis will be used to examine the impact of payment policy and COVID-19 on organizational operations, care delivery, and patient outcomes. The results of this study intend to develop evidence addressing concerns about the unintended consequences of the PAC payment policy during the COVID-19 pandemic."
37887689,The Intersection of Health Literacy and Public Health: A Machine Learning-Enhanced Bibliometric Investigation.,"In recent decades, health literacy has garnered increasing attention alongside a variety of public health topics. This study aims to explore trends in this area through a bibliometric analysis. A Random Forest Model was utilized to identify keywords and other metadata that predict average citations in the field. To supplement this machine learning analysis, we have also implemented a bibliometric review of the corpus. Our findings reveal significant positive coefficients for the keywords ""COVID-19"" and ""Male"", underscoring the influence of the pandemic and potential gender-related factors in the literature. On the other hand, the keyword ""Female"" showed a negative coefficient, hinting at possible disparities that warrant further investigation. Additionally, evolving themes such as COVID-19, mental health, and social media were discovered. A significant change was observed in the main publishing journals, while the major contributing authors remained the same. The results hint at the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and a significant association between gender-related keywords on citation likelihood, as well as changing publication strategies, despite the fact that the main researchers remain those who have been studying health literacy since its creation."
37887439,Examining the Impact of Service Quality on Passengers' Intentions to Utilize Rail Transport in the Post-Pandemic Era: An Integrated Approach of SERVQUAL and Health Belief Model.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted railway transportation in developing countries, resulting in reduced passenger demand and economic activity. As a result of the pandemic effect, there is an increased focus on health and safety among potential passengers. To address this issue, the present study aimed to investigate the fundamental factors that contribute to railway transportation service quality (SERVQUAL) and the intention to use intercity train services in Thailand using the health belief model (HBM), with 1600 passenger participants using structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings demonstrated that train operators' service standards remain vital to passengers, and the HBM had a statistically significant impact on shaping passengers' intentions to use train services after an epidemic.

There were numerous reports in the media that Black people were being treated poorly by healthcare providers and that Black healthcare workers felt poorly protected compared to their white counterparts. This paper argues that the National Health Service has been maintained through a system of racial capitalism. The author proposes that to address racial health inequity a more in-depth understanding of our shared colonial history is required."
37887128,Microfluidic Device-Based Virus Detection and Quantification in Future Diagnostic Research: Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The global economic and healthcare crises experienced over the past three years, as a result of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has significantly impacted the commonplace habits of humans around the world. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) phenomenon, has contributed to the deaths of millions of people around the world. The potential diagnostic applications of microfluidic devices have previously been demonstrated to effectively detect and quasi-quantify several different well-known viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. As a result, microfluidics has been further explored as a potential alternative to our currently available rapid tests for highly virulent diseases to better combat and manage future potential outbreaks. The outbreak management during COVID-19 was initially hindered, in part, by the lack of available quantitative rapid tests capable of confirming a person's active infectiousness status. Therefore, this review will explore the use of microfluidic technology, and more specifically RNA-based virus detection methods, as an integral part of improved diagnostic capabilities and will present methods for carrying the lessons learned from COVID-19 forward, toward improved diagnostic outcomes for future pandemic-level threats. This review will first explore the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and how diagnostic technology was shown to have required even greater advancements to keep pace with the transmission of such a highly infectious virus. Secondly, the historical significance of integrating microfluidic technology in diagnostics and how the different types of genetic-based detection methods may vary in their potential practical applications. Lastly, the review will summarize the past, present, and future potential of RNA-based virus detection/diagnosis and how it might be used to better prepare for a future pandemic."
37886756,Digital finance and regional economic resilience: Evidence from 283 cities in China.,"Digital technology provided a new driver for the rapid recovery of the global economy in the post-COVID-19 era. This study examined how digital financing affected regional economic resilience. First, this study constructs a multidimensional regional economic resilience evaluation system and measures the economic resilience levels of 283 Chinese cities for 2012-2021-using the entropy value method. Then, panel data, mediation effect, and threshold effect models were constructed to empirically test the impact mechanism of digital finance (DF) on regional economic resilience. The results show that DF improves regional economic resilience, which is more evident in central and western cities. Capital allocation efficiency, regional innovation, and regional consumption are effective paths, whereas DF affects regional economic resilience by enhancing capital allocation efficiency, strengthening regional innovation capacity, and promoting resident consumption. It is worth noting that excessive financialization can mask the role of DF. These conclusions provide new evidence clarifying the role of DF in promoting rapid economic recovery in the post-COVID-19 era."

Based on organizational information processing theory (OIPT), we propose that the local electronic health record (EHR) systems could improve patient outcomes through improved bed allocation in the local area. In an empirical analysis of county-level weekly hospital data in the US, relative capacity of beds in hospitals with higher EHR was associated with lower 7-, 14-, and 21-day forward-looking COVID-19 death rate at the county-level. Testing for cross-state variation in non-pharmaceutical interventions along contiguous county border-pair analysis to control for spatial correlation varying between state variations in non-pharmaceutical intervention policies, 2SLS analysis using quality ratings, and using foot-traffic data at the US hospitals our findings are generally supported. The findings have implications for policymakers and stakeholders of the local healthcare supply chains and EHR systems."

The aim of this study was to identify health-related variables potentially underlying the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in older persons. We recruited participants in the long-running Doetinchem Cohort Study (DCS) who underwent vaccination as part of the national COVID-19 program, and measured antibody concentrations to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S1) and Nucleoprotein (N) at baseline (T0), and a month after both the first vaccination (T1), and the second vaccination (T2). Associations between the antibody concentrations and demographic variables, including age, sex, socio-economic status (SES), comorbidities (cardiovascular diseases and immune mediated diseases), various health parameters (cardiometabolic markers, inflammation markers, kidney- and lung function) and a composite measure of frailty ('frailty index', ranging from 0 to 1) were tested using multivariate models."

37878924,"The legal precariousness of work relations in the health sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a factor of worker suffering.","The present article analyzed the process of precarious work relations in the health sector, demonstrating how this situation generated illness and suffering among workers. The text sought to register how the institutional adoption of neoliberal economic conceptions, of the reduction of State social policies, coupled with a history of cultural rejection of labor rights, provided the attraction of mechanisms of precarious work for the public sector, notably, the outsourcing of labor and the provision of services. In a second moment, the text points out the legal improprieties committed, presenting the consequences of the weakening of the legal bond in the working conditions of these workers, mainly regarding working hours and remuneration, also highlighting how much the dissemination of these links represented a factor of a general reduction in wages and labor and social security rights in the sector. Data from Fiocruz surveys on working conditions during the pandemic were also presented. The article concludes by showing the urgency of rescuing the legal labor institutes that were abandoned in the historical path studied in order to guide the public health policies in a new direction."

It brings in an unprecedented debate on social and economic inequalities, evidenced in the world, regarding access to vaccines, medicines, tests, PPE, among others, which brought suffering and death. The dispute for these products occurred on a global scale and producing countries closed their markets and commercial dependence led to dramatic situations. During the pandemic, several ethical issues were evidenced: conflicts, dilemmas, and ethical infractions occurred in different situations, such as in health care settings, in the relationship between managers and health care workers, within health care teams, and between health care teams and society. The article also brings the polemic debate whether the deaths caused by COVID-19 in Brazil should be seen as biological or social phenomena: fatality, homicide, mysthanasia or social euthanasia. The article concludes that in public management it is imperative that the Ethics of Responsibility and Humanization of Care be applied. In this context of uncertainties and challenges for humanity, it is fundamental the participation of society around an agenda guided by ethical principles, human dignity, environment, and democracy, with inclusive public and economic policies."

37877206,High-precision rapid testing of omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants in clinical samples using AI-nanopore.,"A digital platform that can rapidly and accurately diagnose pathogenic viral variants, including SARS-CoV-2, will minimize pandemics, public anxiety, and economic losses. We recently reported an artificial intelligence (AI)-nanopore platform that enables testing for Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 with high sensitivity and specificity within five minutes. However, which parts of the virus are recognized by the platform are unknown. Similarly, whether the platform can detect SARS-CoV-2 variants or the presence of the virus in clinical samples needs further study. Here, we demonstrated the platform can distinguish SARS-CoV-2 variants. Further, it identified mutated Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 expressing spike proteins of the delta and omicron variants, indicating it discriminates spike proteins. Finally, we used the platform to identify omicron variants with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 94%, respectively, in saliva specimens from COVID-19 patients. Thus, our results demonstrate the AI-nanopore platform is an effective diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2 variants."
37876443,Muslim young adults' financial strain and financial stress during the COVID-19 pandemic: The moderating role of religiosity.,"The COVID-19 pandemic affected everyone's lives and general well-being worldwide, including young adults. Young adulthood is marked by a shift in various social areas including acquiring financial independence. As the pandemic was an exceptional scenario in all nations, there is a research gap in analysing how it would affect financial experiences of young adults, particularly the Muslim young adults. These individuals may face financial stress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic due to their high level of financial strain. Furthermore, little is still known about the role that religiosity may play in the relationship between the financial strain and financial stress, notably during the pandemic. The objectives of this study were to examine the level of financial strain and financial stress of Muslim young adults, assess the effect of financial strain on financial stress of Muslim young adults and investigate the moderating effect of religiosity on the relationship between Muslim young adults' financial strain and financial stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey of 230 Muslim young adults was conducted in Malaysia. Results showed that thirty percent of Muslim young adults fell under high level of financial strain while majority of them fell under high level of financial stress. Additionally, financial strain had a significant positive effect on the financial stress of Muslim young adults. This means that the more financially strained, the more Muslim young adults experienced financial stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Religiosity, however, did not moderate the relationship between financial strain and financial stress. These results highlighted the significance of comprehending the level of financial strain and financial stress experienced by Muslim young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results provided relevant parties insights in developing strategies for Muslim young adults to manage financial strain and financial stress to reduce the negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic."
37876179,Economic costs related to coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: A systematic literature review.,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the pressure on healthcare systems has been tremendous and it is having a huge economic impact. The objective of this paper is to carry out a systematic literature review of the publications that have analysed the costs derived from COVID-19 from the patient's perspective. Not only is this study aimed at measuring the impact of COVID-19 in economic terms, but also in qualitative terms, analysing, for instance, the types of costs (direct and indirect) and their variations depending on the geographical area under study. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus. The time frame for the analysis was from the start of the pandemic until 9th December 2021. A total of 322 papers were found. The number of articles assessed for eligibility was 32, and after applying the exclusion criteria, 13 papers were included in the qualitative synthesis. Most of the studies analysed only direct costs (69.23%) and were focused on Asia (61.54%), where the larger indirect costs, as well as the greater total costs, were found. However, the higher costs per patient and year were shown for the United States. This investigation showed the importance of COVID-19 in national, regional and local budgets. More studies are to be developed in Europe due to both the existing differences in the health care systems and financing by country and the difference in the incidence of COVID-19 by country and wave."

37874783,Facilitators and barriers to COVID-19 testing in community and clinical settings: Lessons learned from Lesotho and Zambia.,"The sudden emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had a devastating impact on health systems and population health globally. To combat the spread of COVID-19, countries enacted guidelines and safety measures, including testing, contact tracing, and quarantine. It was unclear the extent to which uptake of COVID-19 testing and other health initiatives would be accepted in countries with a history of dealing with widespread communicable disease transmission such as HIV or Tuberculosis. The objective of this study was to understand and compare the facilitators and barriers to COVID-19 testing at hospital sites in two rural communities in Lesotho and community spaces (referred to as hubs) in one urban community in Zambia during active phases of COVID-19 pandemic. Individual interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) were held during March-October 2021 to explore facilitators and barriers to COVID-19 testing. FGDs with 105 community members and health care workers, and 16 individual interviews with key informants and four mystery shoppers were conducted across the two countries. In Zambia, four mystery shopper observations, and eight hub observations were also conducted. Individual country codebooks were developed and combined; thematic analyses were then conducted using the combined codebook. Findings were compared across the two countries, and most were consistent across the two countries. Two primary themes emerged that related to both barriers and facilitators: (1) structural conditions; (2) social implications and attitudes. The structural conditions that operated as barriers in both countries included public health isolation measures and misinformation. In Lesotho, the cost of tests was an additional barrier. The only structural facilitators were in Zambia where the community hubs were found to be accessible and convenient. The social implication barriers related to fear of isolation, stigma, and mental health implications because of quarantine, perceived pain of the test, and compromised privacy. Social facilitators that led to people testing included experiencing COVID-19 firsthand and knowing people who had died because of COVID-19. Across both countries, primary barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 related to structural conditions and social implications and attitudes. Public health measures can be at odds with social and economic realities; pandemic response should balance public health control and the socio-economic needs. Data from Zambia revealed that community-based settings have the potential to increase uptake of testing services. Community-based campaigns to normalize and reduce stigma for COVID-19 testing services are needed."
37872705,Understanding the potential of digital therapies in implementing the standard of care for depression in Europe.,"Depressive disorders represent the largest proportion of mental illnesses, and by 2030, they are expected to be the first cause of disability-adjusted life years [1]. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated prevalence and burden of depression and increased the occurrence of depressive symptoms in general population [2]. The urgency of implementing mental health services to address new barriers to care persuaded clinicians to use telemedicine to follow patients and stay in touch with them, and to explore digital therapeutics (DTx) as potential tools for clinical intervention [2]. The combination of antidepressants and psychotherapy is widely recommended for depression by international guidelines [3] but is less frequently applied in real-world practice. Commonly used treatments are pharmacological, but while being effective, some aspects such as adherence to the drug regimen, residual symptoms, resistance, lack of information, and stigma may hinder successful treatment. In case of less severe depression, standalone psychological therapies should be the first-line treatment option [3], but access to trained psychotherapists remains inequitable. DTx are evidence-based therapies driven by software programs to treat or complement treatment of a specific disease. DTx are classified as Medical Devices, and given their therapeutic purpose, they need to be validated through randomized controlled clinical trials, as for drug-based therapies. In the last 10 years, studies of digital interventions have proliferated; these studies demonstrate that digital interventions increase remission rates and lower the severity of depressive symptoms compared with waitlist, treatment as usual, and attention control conditions [4]. Despite the efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials, many of these tools never reach real-life patients; thus, it might be necessary to implement DTx in the public health system to expand access to valid treatment options. In this framework, DTx represent a good opportunity to help people with depression receive optimal psychotherapeutic care [5]."

37872376,The role of SARS-CoV-2-mediated NF-κB activation in COVID-19 patients.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, now in its third year, has had a profound impact on public health and economics all over the world. Different populations showed varied susceptibility to this virus and mortality after infection. Clinical and laboratory data revealed that the uncontrolled inflammatory response plays an important role in their poor outcome. Herein, we summarized the role of NF-κB activation during SARS-CoV-2 invasion and replication, particularly the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-mediated NF-κB activation. Then we summarized the COVID-19 drugs' impact on NF-κB activation and their problems. A favorable prognosis is linked with timely treatment with NF-κB activation inhibitors, such as TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 monoclonal antibodies. However, further clinical researches are still required to clarify the time window, dosage of administration, contraindication, and potential side effects of these drugs, particularly for COVID-19 patients with hypertension, hyperglycemia, diabetes, or other chronic diseases."

37871821,Incomplete sanitation in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo results in detection of SARS-CoV-2 in headwater streams.,"Among the largest metropolitan regions in the world, the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo (MRSP) represents an important case study for the COVID-19 respiratory disease pandemic because it is home to >20 million people, making it one of the largest metropolitan regions in the global south. Besides the high population density, the MRSP has several problems related to social and economic aspects, which may reflect in the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 virus, such as low income, lack of sanitation and social vulnerability in the peripheral regions of MRSP. In these regions, the input of untreated sewage on the streams and rivers can be frequently observed, which may represent an indicator of poor sewer system. Therefore, this study aimed to identify if streams draining urbanized regions without appropriate sanitation are prone to receive higher loads of detectable SARS-CoV-2 in its waters. For this, we collected water samples from 45 headwater streams distributed across an urbanization gradient (0-100 % of urbanization) in the MRSP, with three replicates in each stream and analyzed the concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA targeting the nucleocapsid N1 and N2 genomic regions. In addition, we analyzed the relationship between the concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and sanitation and social variables. Our results showed that the concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were higher in the streams draining medium to high urbanized catchments, especially because of the lack of sanitation and the higher probabilities to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the stream water was associated with households without a septic tank or sewage system within the catchment, followed by per capita household income. These results reflect the lack of urbanization planning and the lack of sanitation, especially in the poor regions from the MRSP, adding another risk for the already vulnerable population in a metropolitan region from the global south during a pandemic disease."
37871140,"Informing Public Health Policies with Models for Disease Burden, Impact Evaluation, and Economic Evaluation.","Conducting real-world public health experiments is often costly, time-consuming, and ethically challenging, so mathematical models have a long-standing history of being used to inform policy. Applications include estimating disease burden, performing economic evaluation of interventions, and responding to health emergencies such as pandemics. Models played a pivotal role during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing early detection of SARS-CoV-2's pandemic potential and informing subsequent public health measures. While models offer valuable policy insights, they often carry limitations, especially when they depend on assumptions and incomplete data. Striking a balance between accuracy and timely decision-making in rapidly evolving situations such as disease outbreaks is challenging. Modelers need to explore the extent to which their models deviate from representing the real world. The uncertainties inherent in models must be effectively communicated to policy makers and the public. As the field becomes increasingly influential, it needs to develop reporting standards that enable rigorous external scrutiny. Expected final online publication date for the "
37871044,Back to normal? The health care situation of home care receivers across Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications on health.,"The COVID-19 pandemic began impacting Europe in early 2020, posing significant challenges for individuals requiring care. This group is particularly susceptible to severe COVID-19 infections and depends on regular health care services. In this article, we examine the situation of European care recipients aged 50 years and older 18 months after the pandemic outbreak and compare it to the initial phase of the pandemic. In the descriptive section, we illustrate the development of (unmet) care needs and access to health care throughout the pandemic. Additionally, we explore regional variations in health care receipt across Europe. In the analytical section, we shed light on the mid- and long-term health consequences of COVID-19-related restrictions on accessing health care services by making comparisons between care recipients and individuals without care needs. We conducted an analysis using data from the representative Corona Surveys of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Our study examines changes in approximately 3,400 care-dependent older Europeans (aged 50+) interviewed in 2020 and 2021, comparing them with more than 45,000 respondents not receiving care. The dataset provides a cross-national perspective on care recipients across 27 European countries and Israel. Our findings reveal that in 2021, compared to the previous year, difficulties in obtaining personal care from someone outside the household were significantly reduced in Western and Southern European countries. Access to health care services improved over the course of the pandemic, particularly with respect to medical treatments and appointments that had been canceled by health care institutions. However, even 18 months after the COVID-19 outbreak, a considerable number of treatments had been postponed either by respondents themselves or by health care institutions. These delayed medical treatments had adverse effects on the physical and mental health of both care receivers and individuals who did not rely on care."
37870605,Strategies for efficient management of microplastics to achieve life cycle assessment and circular economy.,"The anticipated increase in the influx of plastic waste into aquatic environments has propelled the identification and elimination of plastic waste into the global agenda. The plastics sector generates a significant volume of materials, which, due to their extended durability, accumulate rapidly in natural ecosystems. Consequently, this indiscriminate utilization, along with the deposition of plastic waste (PW) in landfills and inadequate recycling practices, leads to diverse economic, social, and environmental consequences. Microplastics (MPs) are a type of PW that has been fragmented into particles measuring less than 5 mm. These particles have been found in several environments, including the air, soil, freshwater, and ocean ecosystems, where they accumulate in large quantities. In order to gain insight into the ecological risks and resource implications associated with a plastic product, it is strongly advised to conduct life cycle and sustainability analyses. Therefore, this paper examines various strategies aimed at achieving effective management of MP waste in order to develop a conceptual framework for MPs in circular economy and life cycle assessment (LCA). The findings of this study provides a new avenue for future research and contribution to manage MP waste as well as reduce their environmentally hazardous impact."
37870569,Causes and costs of global COVID-19 vaccine inequity.,"Despite the rapid development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines and the widely recognized health and economic benefits of vaccination, there exist stark differences in vaccination rates across country income groups. While more than 70% of the population is fully vaccinated in high-income countries, vaccination rates in low-income countries are only around 30%. The paper reviews the factors behind global COVID-19 vaccine inequity and the health, social, and economic costs triggered by this inequity. The main contributors to vaccine inequity include vaccine nationalism, intellectual property rights, constraints in manufacturing capacity, poor resilience of healthcare systems, and vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine inequity has high costs, including preventable deaths and cases of illnesses in low-income countries, slow economic recovery, and large learning losses among children. Increasing vaccination rates in low-income countries is in the self-interest of higher-income countries as it may prevent the emergence of new variants and continuous disruptions to global supply chains."

37869857,Exploring the Operational and Technical Changes in the Healthcare Sector During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the healthcare sector globally including Sweden, creating subsequent operational and technical changes to the wide range of digital healthcare services utilized by healthcare professionals or end consumers. A qualitative study using a self-assessment survey based on the national health services digital maturity assessment was used to study these changes from the perspective of personnel working in Swedish healthcare-related organizations. The number of 30 respondents was selected using purposive sampling, out of them 11 responded. The study highlighted positively perceived changes such as boosting digitalization, improving the procurement process, and introducing crisis management teams. Improving the offered digital services, the tools' effectiveness, efficiency, and technical support were also some of the results. On the contrary, the negatively perceived changes were limiting access to the services, limiting technical support, and reprioritizing non-essential services and projects."
37869840,Assessing the Landscape of Telehealth Interventions for Women's Health: An Umbrella Review of Recent Advances Post-Pandemic.,"This umbrella review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of telehealth services for women after the COVID-19 pandemic. The review synthesizes findings from 21 reviews, covering diverse topics such as cancer care, pregnancy and postpartum care, general health, and specific populations. While some areas have shown promising results, others require further research to better understand the potential of digital health interventions. The review identifies gaps in knowledge and highlights the need for more rigorous and comprehensive research to address the limitations and gaps identified in the current evidence base. This includes prioritizing the use of standardized guidelines, quality assessment tools, and meta-analyses, as well as exploring the comparative effectiveness of different digital health interventions, the experiences of specific populations, and the cost-effectiveness of these technologies. By addressing these gaps, this umbrella review can inform future research and policy decisions, ultimately improving women's health outcomes in the post-pandemic era."
37869539,COVID-19 incidence of poverty: How has disease affected the cost of purchasing food in Pakistan.,"COVID-19 harms health and income generation activities. The pandemic caused poverty, and food crisis in the most vulnerable and underprivileged segments. Economic turbulence and massive poverty during epidemic period probably resulted in short-term food insecurity and low food consumption. Based on these concerns, the current study examined how COVID-19 has impacted Pakistan's cost of purchasing food. The study surveyed total 1067 Punjab and Sindh residents in Pakistan, from July to October 2021. A structural equation model was used to examine the interrelationship among food intake, food purchasing cost, and health effects. We investigated whether people experienced substantial effects from the loss of a source of income, work hours, debt burden, and food inflation on their food intake. These circumstances all negatively affected food intake, reducing food consumption. Besides COVID-19's effects on direct income, 41% more people fall into poverty and 23% can't afford healthy food. People's socioeconomic circumstances affects poverty levels and affordable healthy food costs. The cost of purchasing food is significantly correlated with health outcomes. A significant and positive correlation between COVID-19 and income effects, and a negative correlation between food consumption and adverse income effects was explored. In addition, people increased their demand for food assistance during COVID-19 to mitigate negative income shocks. People who cannot afford minimal food costs should be offered food through mobile vehicles or delivery channels in the short term. Cash transfers or subsidies could also be provided to the needy during crisis time."
37869537,"Biden's approval, record inflation, economic recovery, COVID-19 mortality, and vaccination rate among Americans-A longitudinal study of state-level data from April 2021 to January 2022.","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought an unprecedented impact on Americans for over three years. One effective strategy to mitigate the pandemic's damage lies in the vaccine. This study aims to investigate the effects of state-level predictors that vary month-by-month on changes in vaccination rates. Panel data of state-level indicators are built for all 50 states from April 2021 to January 2022. The dependent variable is the monthly increase in vaccination rate, and the independent variables include measures of Biden's approval, inflation, economic recovery, and COVID-19 mortality for each month of this study period. Fixed-effects regression is adopted for longitudinal statistical estimation. Findings show that over time Biden's approval and COVID-19 death are positively associated with the growth in the vaccination rate, while inflation and economic recovery are negatively associated with the vaccination rate. Significant interactions are identified among these predictors. The findings from analyzing panel indicators at the state level complement the current literature dominated by examining cross-sectional data and provide public health officials with fresh insights to promote the vaccine rollout."
37869464,Mining Google Trends data for nowcasting and forecasting colorectal cancer (CRC) prevalence.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent and second most lethal form of cancer in the world. Consequently, CRC cancer prevalence projections are essential for assessing the future burden of the disease, planning resource allocation, and developing service delivery strategies, as well as for grasping the shifting environment of cancer risk factors. However, unlike cancer incidence and mortality rates, national and international agencies do not routinely issue projections for cancer prevalence. Moreover, the limited or even nonexistent cancer statistics for large portions of the world, along with the high heterogeneity among world nations, further complicate the task of producing timely and accurate CRC prevalence projections. In this situation, population interest, as shown by Internet searches, can be very important for improving cancer statistics and, in the long run, for helping cancer research."

37868587,Predictors of depression: lifestyle choices during the pandemic.,"Our study intends to specify the impact of the singular pandemic stressors on the population and also quantify the contribution of different predictors of depression; some of them are stronger than others, and this research shows how the whole effect is divided into single items. This research included a structured online survey using data from 11,340 respondents from six European countries during the first months of the pandemic. The statistical analysis focused on how behavioural patterns appear in different groups of the population and how they mark the psychological wellbeing of these groups with regard to various factors. We targeted social media's role and analyzed the impact of its consumption on symptoms of depression in different groups divided by age and other characteristics. The analysis creates a mosaic of lifestyle choices and other characteristics that manifest different effects on depression inside selected groups whereas several groups generated by the cluster analysis are less vulnerable to their effect than others. Regarding our findings, the perceived reality through information sources and the manner of their processing seems to be more significant than the tangible reality (poor self-reported health correlated with depression more strongly than intrinsic health limitations)."
37868494,The Safety and Effectiveness of mRNA Vaccines Against SARS-CoV-2.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in numerous deaths worldwide, along with devastating economic disruptions, and has posed unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems around the world. In the wake of COVID-19's emergence in 2019, a variety of vaccine technologies were formulated and developed, including those that drew from the technology employed in messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, designed to curb the disease's transmission and manage the pandemic. mRNA vaccine has several advantages over traditional ones, and hence its development has received considerable attention recently. Researchers believe the mRNA vaccine technology will emerge as the leading technology because it is potent, inexpensive, rapidly developed, and safe. This article provides an overview of mRNA vaccines with a special focus on the efficacy and safety of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines against the different variants of COVID-19 and compare them with the Oxford-AstraZeneca (viral vector) and Sinopharm (inactivated virus) vaccines. The clinical data reviewed in this article demonstrate that the currently authorized Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines are highly safe and potent against different variants of COVID-19, especially in comparison with Oxford-AstraZeneca (viral vector) and Sinopharm (inactivated virus) vaccines."
37868177,PERINATAL ASPECTS OF SARS-CoV-2 INFECTION DURING PREGNANCY: A POTENTIAL CAUSE FOR CONCERN.,"Ever since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty regarding clinical presentation and differences among various subpopulations exist. With more than 209,870,000 confirmed cases and more than 4,400,000 deaths worldwide, we are facing the new era of health crisis which will undoubtedly impair global health, economic and social circumstances. In the past year, numerous genetic mutations which code SARS-CoV-2 proteins led to the occurrence of new viral strains, with higher transmission rates. Apart from the implementation of vaccination, the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on pregnancy outcome and maternal fetal transmission remains an important concern. Although neonates diagnosed with COVID-19 were mostly asymptomatic or presented with mild disease, the effect on early pregnancy is yet to be evident. While positive finding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in some samples such as amniotic fluid, placental tissue, cord blood and breast milk exists, additional research should confirm its association with transplacental transmission."
37867823,Evolution and current state of research into E-learning.,"This article aims to undertake a bibliometric review along with a conceptual and intellectual analysis of research on distance learning and e-learning. The purpose of this study is to focus on several academic fields and offer a comprehensive approach on how research on distance learning and e-learning has been approached since 1970. This work applies several bibliometric techniques to assess the research evolution of topics addressed, the most productive authors and the most influential journals. The findings revealed an exponential increase of publications over the last 20 years, highlighting the evolution of topics. The research themes include four main groups: the first relates to pedagogical processes in terms of effectiveness, outcomes, learning strategies, interaction, and self-regulation; the second group includes aspects associated with ICT applied in distance education; the third group focuses on the perceived value, usefulness, acceptance, and satisfaction of e-learning; and the last group portrays the forced application of distance learning strategies to deal with the consequences of the pandemic. This work contributes to expanding the existing literature devoted to study the structure of research on e-learning. It analyses the most representative authors, institutions, and documents, and gathers the growing literature on e-learning, from distance learning in the seventies until the implementation of online learning in the COVID-19 era."
37867811,Impact of COVID-19 on investor sentiment in China's stock markets.,"Large-scale public health emergencies may exert significant adverse effects on market sentiment. This study utilizes interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) to explore the shift in Chinese investors' sentiment in response to the uncertainties due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The empirical findings demonstrate that COVID-19 had a notable impact on investor sentiment within China's stock markets. Before the outbreak of COVID-19, investor sentiment had been on an upward trend. However, since the onset of the pandemic, there has been a sustained decline in investor sentiment, aligning with the downward trend observed in China's stock markets. Interestingly, the immediate effect of the COVID-19 intervention was positive, briefly boosting investor sentiment. As of 2023, with the conclusion of the pandemic and the Chinese government's decision to end the zero COVID-19 policy, we anticipate resurgence in investor sentiment within China's stock markets."

The research uses the BK model and considers both high- and low-frequency bands. According to the dynamic spillover indices and connectedness network, natural gas market, uncertainty, and stock market spillover influences are concentrated in the high-frequency band within 12 trading weeks and minor in the low-frequency band. The natural gas market receives information in the return model. In contrast, the uncertainty of the financial and energy market is the primary transmitter and substantially impacts the natural gas market return. In the volatility model, the natural gas market remains the information receiver but is affected by financial market uncertainty and stock market volatility. During the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, results indicate that financial market uncertainty, energy market uncertainty, and stock market volatility exerted a substantial influence on the natural gas market."
37863848,Anthrax in one health in Southern and Southeastern Europe - the effect of climate change?,"Anthrax is a serious infection caused by Bacillus anthracis. The anthracis spores are highly resistant and can persist in the environment for several decades. Therefore, anthrax is considered a global health threat affecting wildlife, livestock, and the general public. The resistance mechanism is influenced not only by the environment or the ecological niche but also by virulence factors. In the last 10 years the Southern and Southeastern Europe have been confronted with this threat. Recently, there have been 8 human anthrax cases reported in Croatia (2022), and 4 cases in Romania (2023). Moreover, this incident and the COVID situation could be a starting point to encourage researchers to raise the alarm. On the other hand, climate change is causing glaciers to melt and land to thaw, and many wetlands and swampy areas are being drained. It should not be forgotten that epidemiological and epizootic threats significantly affect the country's economic development. The Covid-19 epidemic best illustrates these threats."

37862313,Key performance indicators of COVID-19 contact tracing in Belgium from September 2020 to December 2021.,"The goal of tracing, testing, and quarantining contacts of infected individuals is to contain the spread of infectious diseases, a strategy widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, limited research exists on the effectiveness of contact tracing, especially with regard to key performance indicators (KPIs), such as the proportion of cases arising from previously identified contacts. In our study, we analyzed contact tracing data from Belgium collected between September 2020 and December 2021 to assess the impact of contact tracing on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and understand its characteristics. Among confirmed cases involved in contact tracing in the Flemish and Brussels-Capital regions, 19.1% were previously identified as close contacts and were aware of prior exposure. These cases, referred to as 'known' to contact tracing operators, reported on average fewer close contacts compared to newly identified individuals (0.80 versus 1.05), resulting in fewer secondary cases (0.23 versus 0.28). Additionally, we calculated the secondary attack rate, representing infections per contact, which was on average lower for the 'known' cases (0.22 versus 0.25) between December 2020 and August 2021. These findings indicate the effectiveness of contact tracing in Belgium in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Although we were unable to quantify the exact number of prevented cases, our findings emphasize the importance of contact tracing as a public health measure. In addition, contact tracing data provide indications of potential shifts in transmission patterns among different age groups associated with emerging variants of concern and increasing vaccination rates."

37860577,The COVID-19 shock and the ownership of store Chain：Evidence from China's express delivery industry.,"Utilizing stock market data of express delivery companies that have been listed on the stock market of China, this paper intends to examine the two alternative store chain ownership, namely corporate-owned versus franchised, which is more resilient to external shocks. Based on the price data of 1034 trading days from December 2, 2019, to September 30, 2022, the Quandt-Andrews method is used to compare the companies of corporate-owned store chain with those of franchised store chain. The results reveal that the stock market performance of the express delivery industry underwent a huge structural change during the COVID-19 epidemic. Moreover, because of the stringent pandemic control measures, there are significant differences in structural changes between the two types of express delivery companies, corporate-owned store chain as opposed to franchised store chain. The structural changes occurred earlier for the former, which suggests that the companies of corporate-owned store chain are more resilient to recovery. This study can provide helpful insight into better risk control for companies managing retail stores and choosing ""rainy day assets"" portfolios for investors in times of financial uncertainty."
37860511,Political stability as a major determinant of the Covid-19 pandemic outcomes.,"This paper explores the role of political stability in explaining the cross-country variation of Covid-19 pandemic outcomes. Based on the international evidence, we find that lower pre-Covid-19 levels of political stability are associated with worse Covid-19 pandemic outcomes. Politically unstable countries are more likely to suffered significantly higher morbidity and mortality. Further analysis shows that political stability only matters in countries prepared with requisite medical capacity to deal with health emergencies. We also find that political stability is more crucial in countries with higher poverty rates. Overall, to combat Covid-19 and the subsequential collective threats successfully, the national authorities should pay more attention to maintain political stability."

37858361,"Unions, democracy, and Trump: Deconstructing the COVID-19 vaccination crisis of 2021.","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges for U.S. workers, especially those in essential occupations. As most public health experts view vaccination as the only certain path to defeating the virus, this study examines how union membership, political participation, and support for Trump have affected adult vaccination rates. The analyses also explore how these interrelated factors intersect to either exacerbate or reduce the ongoing public health crisis. Using vaccination data from 3112 U.S. counties in July of 2021, this study finds strong support for claims that localities with high levels of support for Trump have lower percentages of adults vaccinated, while areas with higher union coverage and higher voter turnout are associated with higher rates of vaccination. Moreover, the results show that the positive effects of union density are enhanced in counties with higher rates of voter turnout and support for Trump, revealing a complex relationship between unions, democracy and partisan politics. The results suggest that workplace and political democracy can effectively facilitate individual and collective responses to large-scale collective action problems such as the COVID-19 pandemic."
37858175,Opportunities to strengthen resilience of health care workers regarding patient safety.,"The COVID-19 pandemic endangered the quality of health care and the safety of patients and health care workers (HCWs). This provided challenges for HCWs' resilience and for hospital management and probably increased risks for patient safety incidents (PSI). HCWs may also have experienced psychological consequences as second victims of PSI, but evidence on this is lacking. Therefore, we mapped HCWs' experiences with PSI during the second wave of COVID-19, the associations of these experiences with the hospital management of patient safety culture and HCWs' interests in receiving further training."

37857244,Gig work and mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic: A gendered examination of comparisons with regular employment and unemployment.,"The rise of the platform economy during the Covid-19 pandemic has stimulated extensive discussions about whether gig workers can obtain equivalent mental health benefits of regular paid employment. Drawing on nationally representative data in the UK, this study aims to examine (1) whether transitioning from no paid work to gig work during Covid-19 is associated with better or worse mental health compared with those who remained not employed and those who became employed in regular jobs; (2) what mechanisms can explain the mental health differences; (3) how the patterns may differ by gender. The results show that transition into gig work is associated with better mental health compared with those who remained not employed, but this pattern is only for male (rather than female) gig workers and can be largely explained by their better financial situation and lower level of loneliness. For both men and women, the transition into gig work is associated with worse mental health compared with the transition into regular employment, but the mechanisms vary across genders. For male gig workers, both higher levels of financial precarity and loneliness in gig work can explain their mental health disadvantages compared with regular workers, but for female gig workers, none of them is at work. These findings facilitate a better understanding of the health consequences of the gig economy, revealing important gender-differentiated socio-psychological mechanisms through which gig work shapes mental health."

37857237,Hybrid health regimes: Access to primary care physicians and COVID-19 vaccine uptake across municipalities in Romania.,"This study analyses COVID-19 vaccine uptake at the municipal level in Romania using the global health regimes and vaccine hesitancy perspectives. Our spatial regression (SARAR-het Durbin) shows that the number of primary care physicians is a significant predictor of vaccine uptake, and municipalities with higher access to the labour market have higher vaccination rates. We provide a historical perspective to demonstrate that the current health regime in Romania is a hybrid of internationalist and global health regimes, with socialist investments affecting labour participation, education, poverty, and vaccination rates. Our findings highlight the impact of regional disparities and partial privatization of the health system."
37856760,A Digital Mask-Voiceprint System for Postpandemic Surveillance and Tracing Based on the STRONG Strategy.,"Lockdowns and border closures due to COVID-19 imposed mental, social, and financial hardships in many societies. Living with the virus and resuming normal life are increasingly being advocated due to decreasing virus severity and widespread vaccine coverage. However, current trends indicate a continued absence of effective contingency plans to stop the next more virulent variant of the pandemic. The COVID-19-related mask waste crisis has also caused serious environmental problems and virus spreads. It is timely and important to consider how to precisely implement surveillance for the dynamic clearance of COVID-19 and how to efficiently manage discarded masks to minimize disease transmission and environmental hazards. In this viewpoint, we sought to address this issue by proposing an appropriate strategy for intelligent surveillance of infected cases and centralized management of mask waste. Such an intelligent strategy against COVID-19, consisting of wearable mask sample collectors (masklect) and voiceprints and based on the STRONG (Spatiotemporal Reporting Over Network and GPS) strategy, could enable the resumption of social activities and economic recovery and ensure a safe public health environment sustainably."
37856425,Does the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown affect risk attitudes?-Evidence from rural Thailand.,"Empirical research provides evidence on changes in individuals' risk attitudes after experiencing exogenous shocks. The global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has had various adverse impacts on economies and households. This study utilizes the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying lockdown to explore its impact on risk attitudes in rural Thailand using a difference-in-difference (DiD) approach. Overall, we do not find evidence on considerable changes in the willingness to take risks of rural household members after experiencing a lockdown during the pandemic. However, a significant heterogenous effect is found between individuals working inside and outside the agricultural sector. Individuals working outside the agricultural sector have a statistically significant reduction in their willingness to take risks after experiencing a lockdown. Our study provides additional empirical evidence to understand the impact of shocks on rural households' risk attitudes. This sheds light on how policy designs can better help mitigate downward economic trends following exogenous shocks."

37854414,Potential mechanisms by which cash transfer programmes could improve the mental health and life chances of young people: A conceptual framework and lines of enquiry for research and policy.,"Mental health is inextricably linked to both poverty and future life chances such as education, skills, labour market attachment and social function. Poverty can lead to poorer mental health, which reduces opportunities and increases the risk of lifetime poverty. Cash transfer programmes are one of the most common strategies to reduce poverty and now reach substantial proportions of populations living in low- and middle-income countries. Because of their rapid expansion in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, they have recently gained even more importance. Recently, there have been suggestions that these cash transfers might improve youth mental health, disrupting the cycle of disadvantage at a critical period of life. Here, we present a conceptual framework describing potential mechanisms by which cash transfer programmes could improve the mental health and life chances of young people. Furthermore, we explore how theories from behavioural economics and cognitive psychology could be used to more specifically target these mechanisms and optimise the impact of cash transfers on youth mental health and life chances. Based on this, we identify several lines of enquiry and action for future research and policy."

This study aimed to examine the associations of movement behaviors with mental health outcomes among overweight/obese college students using a compositional data analysis approach."
37853542,Resilience patterns of urban road networks under the worst-case localized disruptions.,"Recent events, including COVID-19, extreme floods, and explosion accidents, commonly induced localized closures and disruptions of urban road networks (URNs), resulting in significant impacts on human mobility and socio-economic activities. Existing studies on URN resilience to those events mainly took few cases for empirical studies, limiting our understanding on the URN resilience patterns across different cities. By conducting a large-scale nationwide resilience analysis of URNs in 363 cities in mainland China, this study attempts to uncover the resilience patterns of URNs against the worst-case single (SLDs) and multiple localized disruptions (MLDs). Results show that the distance from the worst-case SLD to the city center would be less than 5 km in 62.3% cities, as opposed to more than 15 km in 14.3% cities. Moreover, the average road network resilience of cities in western China could be 7% and 13% smaller than that of the eastern cities under the worst-case SLDs and MLDs, respectively. This inequality in the worst-case resilience is partly attributable to variations in urban socio-economic, infrastructure-related, and topographic factors. These findings could inspire nationwide pre-disaster mitigation strategies to cope with localized disruptions and help transfer insights for mitigation strategies against disruptive events across cities."

37853084,"Urban nature visitation, accessibility, and impact of travel distance for sustainable cities.","Accessible urban nature is a key component of creating sustainable urban communities and promoting human health and well-being. To balance the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, the United Nations adopted several sustainable developmental goals (SDGs), such as SDG 11 for sustainable cities and communities, which aims to improve urban planning and management, including equitable access to urban nature. However, more information is still needed regarding how planners and managers can promote urban nature visitation and equitable access during health and environmental crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to examine trends in urban nature visitation during the pandemic and then to determine if the effect of the pandemic on the frequency of urban nature site visitation varied by distance to home, using an innovative approach of analyzing both publicly available large-scale mobility data and a web-based survey of urban residents of Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel. The mobility data results showed that there was a negative mean % difference in park visits compared to baseline during the first and third lockdowns, but an increase compared to baseline between lockdowns and even during the second lockdown. This suggests that urban residents had greater need to reconnect with urban nature during and after periods of intense stress. In addition, the survey results showed an increasing negative effect of distance on urban nature site visitation during the pandemic, specifically for urban nature sites located more than 1 km from home. Altogether, the mobility data and survey results suggest that people who lived within 1 km of their preferred urban nature site had disproportionate access to the benefits of urban nature during and after lockdowns than others. To effectively make social and ecological transitions toward urban sustainability, it is vital that cities promote urban nature accessibility during current and future environmental and health crises. Cities should collaborate with diverse stakeholders to create/maintain accessible urban nature sites nearby all sociodemographic groups, provide sustainability education and training to convey the benefits of urban nature, and pursue participatory solutions for understanding urban nature needs and preferences. In this manner, it will be possible to address the growing influence of proximity/travel distance and additional factors that affect urban nature visitation and ultimately, human health and urban sustainability."
37851662,Changes in economic activity and mental distress among young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: Differences between the first and second infection waves in the UK.,"While infection rates, lockdown policies, and labor market conditions substantially varied across COVID-19 waves, the majority of evidence on young adults' mental health remains focused on initial responses in early 2020. The variability of the relationship between economic activity and mental health over time therefore remains poorly understood in this age group."
37851661,Retrospective evaluation of real-time estimates of global COVID-19 transmission trends and mortality forecasts.,"Since 8th March 2020 up to the time of writing, we have been producing near real-time weekly estimates of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and forecasts of deaths due to COVID-19 for all countries with evidence of sustained transmission, shared online. We also developed a novel heuristic to combine weekly estimates of transmissibility to produce forecasts over a 4-week horizon. Here we present a retrospective evaluation of the forecasts produced between 8th March to 29th November 2020 for 81 countries. We evaluated the robustness of the forecasts produced in real-time using relative error, coverage probability, and comparisons with null models. During the 39-week period covered by this study, both the short- and medium-term forecasts captured well the epidemic trajectory across different waves of COVID-19 infections with small relative errors over the forecast horizon. The model was well calibrated with 56.3% and 45.6% of the observations lying in the 50% Credible Interval in 1-week and 4-week ahead forecasts respectively. The retrospective evaluation of our models shows that simple transmission models calibrated using routine disease surveillance data can reliably capture the epidemic trajectory in multiple countries. The medium-term forecasts can be used in conjunction with the short-term forecasts of COVID-19 mortality as a useful planning tool as countries continue to relax public health measures."
37851624,Public economic gains from tax-financed investments in childhood immunization in the United States.,"The emergence of COVID-19 has displayed the importance of immunization and the need for continued public investment in vaccination programs. Globally, national vaccination programs rely heavily on tax-financed expenditure, requiring upfront investments and ongoing financial commitments. To evaluate annual public investments, we conducted a fiscal analysis that quantifies the public economic consequences to government in the United States attributable to childhood vaccination. To estimate the change in net government revenue, we developed a decision-analytic model that quantifies lifetime tax revenues and transfers based on changes in morbidity and mortality arising from vaccination of the 2017 U.S. birth cohort. Reductions in deaths and comorbid conditions attributed to pediatric vaccines were used to derive gross lifetime earnings gains, tax revenue gains attributed to averted morbidity and mortality avoided, disability transfer cost savings, and averted special education costs associated with each vaccine. Our analysis indicates a fiscal dividend of $41.7 billion from vaccinating this cohort. The bulk of this gain for government reflects avoiding the loss of $30.6 billion in present-value tax revenues. All pediatric vaccines raise tax revenues by reducing vaccine-preventable morbidity and mortality in amounts ranging from $7.3 million (hepatitis A) to $20.3 billion (diphtheria) over the life course. Based on public investments in pediatric vaccines, a benefit-cost ratio of 17.8 was calculated for each dollar invested in childhood immunization. The public economic yield attributed to childhood vaccination in the U.S. is significant from a government perspective, providing fiscal justification for ongoing investment."

Evidence suggests that this overburden is due to complex interactions between individual and structural factors. Some groups of working migrants were in vulnerable positions, overrepresented in essential jobs, under precarious work conditions, and ineligible for social benefits or special COVID-19 economic assistance. This study aimed to explore the experience of migrants working in Norway during the COVID-19 pandemic to gather an in-depth understanding of the pandemic´s impact on their health and well-being, focusing on occupation-related factors."

37847683,"Impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of men experiencing homelessness: A cross-sectional study in Osaka, Japan.","The novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively impacted not only our physical health but also mental health, including increasing depressive and anxiety symptoms. In particular, socially and physically vulnerable populations, such as people experiencing homelessness (PEH), may be more likely to have their mental health worsened by the pandemic due to having more difficulty meeting basic human needs. Therefore, this study aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 on mental health of the homeless in Japan by evaluating depressive and anxiety symptoms and identifying the associated factors particularly, sociodemographic variables as age, employment status and the fear and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. A cross-sectional interview survey among 158 PEH in Osaka Prefecture was conducted from April to May 2022. The survey included sociodemographic questions and history and perceived risk of infection with COVID-19. Depressive symptoms were measured using the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and anxiety symptoms using the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and the fear of COVID-19 using the seven-item Fear of New Coronavirus Scale (FCV-19S). In this study, the prevalence of depression (PHQ-9≥10) was 38.6%, anxiety disorder (GAD≥10) was 19.0%, and high fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19S≥19) was 28.5%. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that PEH in younger age groups (18-34 years), and with joblessness, higher perceived infection risk, and higher fear of COVID-19 were more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety (p<0.05). These results indicate that the younger PEHs with worsened economic conditions and therefore, feel threatened by COVID-19 the pandemic are at higher risk of mental health deterioration. More focused research and mental health services need to be provided to this population in the future."
37847532,Influenza Epidemic Trend Surveillance and Prediction Based on Search Engine Data: Deep Learning Model Study.,"Influenza outbreaks pose a significant threat to global public health. Traditional surveillance systems and simple algorithms often struggle to predict influenza outbreaks in an accurate and timely manner. Big data and modern technology have offered new modalities for disease surveillance and prediction. Influenza-like illness can serve as a valuable surveillance tool for emerging respiratory infectious diseases like influenza and COVID-19, especially when reported case data may not fully reflect the actual epidemic curve."
37847441,Working from Home During Covid-19 Pandemic and Changes to Fertility Intentions Among Parents.,"The Covid-19 pandemic and related massive spread of home based work led to substantial changes in the conditions for combining work and childbearing. On the one hand, working from home helped parents to accommodate increased childcare needs during the pandemic. On the other hand, it led to acute experiences of blurred boundaries between work and family life during childcare and school closures. Therefore, the direction of the impact of working from home on fertility intentions during the pandemic is not unequivocal. In this paper, we investigate how working from home was related to change in fertility intentions of mothers and fathers during the pandemic and discuss the complex mechanisms behind these relationships. With the use of unique Familydemic Survey data from a representative sample of parents in Poland, we estimate multinomial logit regressions by gender and consider a set of potential moderators, including financial well-being, gender relations, and occupational characteristics. We find evidence for an overall negative relationship between home based work and fertility intentions for mothers, but we also uncover some positive moderating effects. In particular, we shed light on the unobvious moderating role of gendered division of unpaid labor from before the pandemic."
37847427,Understanding the impact of Covid-19 on the delivery and receipt of prison healthcare: an international scoping review.,"People being held in prison are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 infection, as places of detention are high-risk environments for spread of infection. Due to this risk, many prisons across the globe introduced measures to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission. The pandemic changed almost all aspects of prison life, including prison healthcare provision. We undertook a scoping review to understand what is known about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the receipt and delivery of prison healthcare. This scoping review is part of a wider mixed-methods study focusing more specifically on the impact that Covid-19 had on prison healthcare delivery in England."

37846519,Application of COVIDTracer to Inform Public Health Workforce Planning in Alaska During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused social and economic disruption worldwide and spurred numerous mitigation strategies, including state investments in training a large contact tracing and case investigation workforce. A team at the University of Alaska Anchorage evaluated implementation of the COVID-19 contact tracing and case investigation program of the State of Alaska Department of Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health, Section of Public Health Nursing. As part of that evaluation, the team used COVIDTracer, a spreadsheet modeling tool. COVIDTracer generated projections of COVID-19 case counts that informed estimates of workforce needs and case prioritization strategies. Case count projections approximated the reported epidemiologic curve with a median 7% difference in the first month. The accuracy of case count predictions declined after 1 month with a median difference of 80% in the second month. COVIDTracer inputs included previous case counts, the average length of time for telephone calls to cases and outreach to identified contacts, and the average number of contacts per case. As each variable increased, so too did estimated workforce needs. Decreasing the average time from exposure to outreach from 10 to 5 days reduced case counts estimated by COVIDTracer by approximately 93% during a 5-month period. COVIDTracer estimates informed Alaska's workforce planning and decisions about prioritizing case investigation during the pandemic. Lessons learned included the importance of being able to rapidly scale up and scale down workforce to adjust to a dynamic crisis and the limitations of prediction modeling (eg, that COVIDTracer was accurate for only about 1 month into the future). These findings may be useful for future pandemic preparedness planning and other public health emergency response activities."
37846348,Examining Global Crises: Extracting Insights From the COVID-19 Pandemic and Natural Disasters to Develop a Robust Emergency Diabetic Retinopathy Strategy for Puerto Rico.,"In this critical analysis, we investigate the profound impact of natural disasters and pandemics on the care and adherence to treating diabetic retinopathy, a severe complication of diabetes requiring continuous monitoring and treatment to prevent vision loss. Our study also sheds light on the social and economic context of Puerto Rico, emphasizing recent emergency events that have exacerbated existing public health challenges. Through a comprehensive review of relevant literature from PubMed, Google Scholar, and the George Washington University Himmelfarb Health Sciences Library database, we identified 31 pertinent articles out of 45 evaluated, focusing on the effects of these crises on healthcare delivery, diabetic retinopathy screening, and treatment. The evidence strongly indicates that during such emergencies, barriers to healthcare escalate, leading to significant treatment delays and a reduction in diabetic retinopathy screening and diagnosis, ultimately resulting in deteriorated visual outcomes. Thus, our review underscores the urgent need for the development of effective emergency plans tailored specifically to diabetic retinopathy, particularly in Puerto Rico, where diabetes prevalence and its complications are notably higher. Such plans should not only incorporate established emergency measures but also harness emerging technological advances in the field of ophthalmology to ensure optimal preparedness for future pandemics and natural disasters."

37845382,IoT platforms assessment methodology for COVID-19 vaccine logistics and transportation: a multi-methods decision making model.,"The supply chain management (SCM) of COVID-19 vaccine is the most daunting task for logistics and supply managers due to temperature sensitivity and complex logistics process. Therefore, several technologies have been applied but the complexity of COVID-19 vaccine makes the Internet of Things (IoT) a strong use case due to its multiple features support like excursion notification, data sharing, connectivity management, secure shipping, real-time tracking and monitoring etc. All these features can only feasible through choosing and deploying the right IoT platform. However, selection of right IoT platform is also a major concern due to lack of experience and technical knowledge of supply chain managers and diversified landscape of IoT platforms. Therefore, we introduce a decision making model for evaluation and decision making of IoT platforms that fits for logistics and transportation (L&T) process of COVID-19 vaccine. This study initially identifies the major challenges addressed during the SCM of COVID-19 vaccine and then provides reasonable solution by presenting the assessment model for selection of rational IoT platform. The proposed model applies hybrid Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach for evaluation. It also adopts Estimation-Talk-Estimation (ETE) approach for response collection during the survey. As, this is first kind of model so the proposed model is validated and tested by conducting a survey with experts. The results of the proposed decision making model are also verified by Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) technique which indicates higher results accuracy and reliability of the proposed model. Similarly, the proposed model yields the best possible results and it can be judged by the precision, accuracy and recall values i.e. 93%, 93% and 94% respectively. The survey-based testing also suggests that this model can be adopted in practical scenarios to deal with complexities which may arise during the decision making of IoT platform for COVID-19 SCM process."

37843366,DHA and EPA inhibit porcine coronavirus replication by alleviating ER stress.,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) highlighted significant gaps in our mechanisms to prevent and control cross-species transmission of animal coronaviruses. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) are common porcine coronaviruses with similar clinical features. In the absence of effective drugs and methods of prevention and control, outbreaks of these viruses have led to significant economic losses in the global pig industry. Here, we report the effect of five fatty acids against porcine coronaviruses: sodium butyrate, lauric acid, palmitic acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). DHA and EPA reduced viral replication by attenuating the endoplasmic reticulum stress and inhibiting PEDV, TGEV, and PDCoV infections in vero cells, PK-15 cells, and LLC-PK1 cells "
37842631,Dividend policy and crisis: Exploring the interplay between performance and financial constraints in the French context.,"The purpose of this paper is to determine the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis on dividend policy and performance and explore the interplay between performance and financial constraints to identify how such a fit affected dividend policy during the crisis. We used a final sample of 106 SBF-listed firms during six years. To assess the effect of the crisis, we divided this period into three subperiods: pre-crisis (2016-2018), pandemic period (2019-2021), and all periods (2016-2021). A System Generalized Method of Moments (SGMM) is used to deal with the problem of endogeneity caused by the lagged dependent variable. The results showed that only the crisis and the financial constraints (KZ index) negatively correlated with dividend payment levels (DivPaid). This dividend level did not take performance into account. Regarding the control variables, only debt, growth, and size positively impacted dividend levels. Moreover, the performance of French companies was negatively influenced by the DividPaid, KZindex, and Crisis variables. The findings suggest that France should prioritize dividend payments to protect a company's reputation and financial health. These findings have significant implications for investors, financial analysts, regulators, and policymakers who are looking for guidance on dividend policy in uncertain situations."
37842030,Progressing Towards Same-Day Discharges After Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy; Safe and Cost Effective to Discharge Without Routine Blood Tests.,"Changing population demographics and the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have forever changed healthcare, with increasing demands on straining systems. The economic cost is yet to be fully realised, with growing concerns around the current system's ability to accommodate the ageing comorbid population. Consequently, a paradigm shift has taken place in healthcare systems, prioritizing cost accountability. In the absence of established guidelines or robust literature, the use of laboratory tests postoperatively is often guided solely by clinician preference. This study presents a retrospective analysis that investigates the utility and cost implications of routine postoperative investigation following robotic-assisted radical prostatectomies. The findings aim to emphasise the importance of evidence-based practices and cost-effective approaches in postoperative care."

37841365,Taking stock of the mutations in human SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins: From early days to nearly the end of COVID-19 pandemic.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causative agent of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in several deaths and severe economic losses throughout the world. The spike protein in the virus binds to the human ACE-2 receptor in order to mediate virus-host interactions required for the viral transmission. Since first report of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence during December 2019 from patient infected with the virus in Wuhan, China, the virus has undergone rapid changes leading to mutations comprising substitutions, deletions and insertions in the sequence resulting in several variants of the virus that were more virulent and transmissible or less virulent but highly transmissible. The timely intervention with COVID-19 vaccines proved to be effective in controlling the number of infections. However, rapid mutations in the virus led to the lowering of vaccine efficacies being administered to people. In May 2023, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 was not a public health emergency of international concern anymore. In order to take stock of mutations in the virus from early days to nearly end of COVID-19 pandemic, sequence analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins available in the NCBI Virus database was carried out. The mutations and invariant residues in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences relative to the reference sequence were analysed. The location of the invariant residues and residues at interface of the protein chains in the spike protein trimer complex structure were examined. A total of 111,298 non-redundant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences representing 2,345,585 spike proteins in the NCBI Virus database showed mutations at 1252 of the 1273 positions in the amino acid sequence. The mutations represented 6129 different mutation types in the sequences analysed. Besides, some sequences also contained insertion mutations. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences represented 1435 lineages. In addition, several spike protein sequences with mutations whose lineages were either 'not classified' or were 'unclassifiable' indicated the virus could still be evolving."

37840553,Mental health concerns precede quits: shifts in the work discourse during the Covid-19 pandemic and great resignation.,"To study the causes of the 2021 Great Resignation, we use text analysis and investigate the changes in work- and quit-related posts between 2018 and 2021 on Reddit. We find that the Reddit discourse evolution resembles the dynamics of the U.S. quit and layoff rates. Furthermore, when the COVID-19 pandemic started, conversations related to working from home, switching jobs, work-related distress, and mental health increased, while discussions on commuting or moving for a job decreased. We distinguish between general work-related and specific quit-related discourse changes using a difference-in-differences method. Our main finding is that mental health and work-related distress topics disproportionally increased among quit-related posts since the onset of the pandemic, likely contributing to the quits of the Great Resignation. Along with better labor market conditions, some relief came beginning-to-mid-2021 when these concerns decreased. Our study underscores the importance of having access to data from online forums, such as Reddit, to study emerging economic phenomena in real time, providing a valuable supplement to traditional labor market surveys and administrative data."

37839956,Early Childhood Caries and Dental Public Health Programmes in Hong Kong.,"The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship amongst early childhood caries (ECC), economic development, and dental public health programmes in Hong Kong. We searched exhaustively qualitative and quantitative data on the oral health policy, dental service, public health strategies of caries control and epidemiologic surveys on ECC. We then performed meta-regression to explore the impact of the Human Development Index (HDI), gross domestic product (GDP) growth, water fluoridation, oral health promotion, dental school establishment, free education, and dental workforce on ECC prevalence in 5-year-olds. We found that the first government oral health survey was conducted in 1960, when Hong Kong experienced significant growth, as the HDI indicated. The survey revealed that 97% of 6- to 8-year-old children experienced ECC. Water fluoridation was implemented in 1961 at 0.7 ppm (0.9 ppm in winter) to prevent caries. The government offered free 9-year education in 1978. In 1981, the government established a dental school to improve a low dentist-to-population ratio of 1:9000. The ECC prevalence amongst 5- to 6- year-old children was reduced from 84% in 1968 to 63% in 1986. The Department of Health created an oral health education division in 1989. The ECC prevalence for 5-year-old children was further reduced to 44% in 1997. The ECC prevalence amongst 5-year-old children was stabilised at 51% both in 2001 and 2011. However in 2021, the prevalence of untreated ECC increased to 57% during the outbreak of COVID-19. Meta-regression analysis showed that ECC prevalence was not linked to GDP growth but decreased with improvements in HDI, the provision of 9-year free education, the establishment of a dental school, fluoridation of water supply, and implementation of territory-wide oral health promotion. In conclusion, better education, living conditions, and dental public health programmes have improved children's oral health in Hong Kong."

The only existing trials of frenotomy are small and underpowered and/or include only very short-term or subjective outcomes."
37838681,Analysis of applying a patient safety taxonomy to patient and clinician-reported incident reports during the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed methods study.,"The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major disruption to healthcare delivery worldwide causing medical services to adapt their standard practices. Learning how these adaptations result in unintended patient harm is essential to mitigate against future incidents. Incident reporting and learning system data can be used to identify areas to improve patient safety. A classification system is required to make sense of such data to identify learning and priorities for further in-depth investigation. The Patient Safety (PISA) classification system was created for this purpose, but it is not known if classification systems are sufficient to capture novel safety concepts arising from crises like the pandemic. We aimed to review the application of the PISA classification system during the COVID-19 pandemic to appraise whether modifications were required to maintain its meaningful use for the pandemic context."

37838441,"Work as a social determinant of health in high-income countries: past, present, and future.","This paper, the first in a three-part Series on work and health, provides a narrative review of research into work as a social determinant of health over the past 25 years, the key emerging challenges in this field, and the implications of these challenges for future research. By use of a conceptual framework for work as a social determinant of health, we identified six emerging challenges: (1) the influence of technology on the nature of work in high-income countries, culminating in the sudden shift to telework during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) the intersectionality of work with gender, sexual orientation, age, race, ethnicity, migrant status, and socioeconomic status as codeterminants of health disparities; (3) the arrival in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries of large migrant labour workforces, who are often subject to adverse working conditions and social exclusion; (4) the development of precarious employment as a feature of many national labour markets; (5) the phenomenon of working long and irregular hours with potential health consequences; and (6) the looming threat of climate change's effects on work. We conclude that profound changes in the nature and availability of work over the past few decades have led to widespread new psychosocial and physical exposures that are associated with adverse health outcomes and contribute to increasing disparities in health. These new exposures at work will require novel and creative methods of data collection for monitoring of their potential health impacts to protect the workforce, and for new research into better means of occupational health promotion and protection. There is also an urgent need for a better integration of occupational health within public health, medicine, the life sciences, and the social sciences, with the work environment explicitly conceptualised as a major social determinant of health."

37837572,"Clinical Characteristics, Diagnosis, and Therapeutics of COVID-19: A Review.","The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that suddenly emerged at the end of December 2019 and caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to afflict humanity, not only seriously affecting healthcare systems but also leading to global social and economic imbalances. As of August 2022, there were approximately 580 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and approximately 6.4 million confirmed deaths due to this disease. The data are sufficient to highlight the seriousness of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although most patients with COVID-19 present primarily with respiratory symptoms, an increasing number of extrapulmonary systemic symptoms and manifestations have been associated with COVID-19. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, much has been learned about the disease and its causative agent. Therefore, great effort has been aimed at developing treatments and drug interventions to treat and reduce the incidence of COVID-19. In this narrative review, we provide a brief overview of the epidemiology, mechanisms, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and therapeutics of COVID-19."
37837415,Why presumptions are important in occupational health: The example of COVID-19 infection as an occupational disease.,"Workers who become ill or injured on the job while undertaking extraordinary risks on behalf of the public are, at times, granted facilitated access to workers' compensation (WC) benefits through the application of presumptions in the compensation process. Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a broad range of occupational groups faced an elevated risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure at work to perform vital services to maintain our food supply, sustain needed transportation, provide health care, assure energy supply and others. Some states or jurisdictions in the United States recognized both the risk and the service of these workers by enacting COVID-19 presumption laws to streamline selected essential workers' eligibility for WC benefits. Other states did not. Results of these contrasting public approaches permit an examination of the impact of presumptions in compensation by examining the frequency and outcomes of COVID-19 claims in ""COVID-19 presumption"" and ""nonpresumption"" states. Despite state-level variations in economic response to the pandemic, industry mix, and presumption eligibility criteria, the use of COVID-19 presumptions appears to have substantially increased claim filing rates and improved access to benefits. Lastly, the additional costs of COVID-19 claims to employers and insurers were lower than initially predicted. In response to future airborne infectious disease outbreaks, workers' compensation presumption laws should be universally implemented to permit a broad range of high-risk workers to work on the public's behalf without fear of losing wages and incurring medical expenses associated with a work-related viral exposure."

The aim of this survey is to evaluate the potential effect of Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence against COVID-19-induced complications.
37835276,The Impact of Social Capital on Socially Responsible Supply Chain Performance: The Moderating Role of Supply Chain Transparency.,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has brought global poverty to the forefront, and existing research suggests that socially responsible supply chains play an important role in poverty alleviation. However, there is limited research on how to improve the performance of socially responsible supply chains. This study innovatively chooses a dual perspective, i.e., companies and farmers in contract farming, the dominant model of socially responsible supply chains in Chinese agriculture, as the research object. Furthermore, it examines the role of social capital on the performance of socially responsible supply chains, as well as the moderating role of supply chain transparency, in order to find out how to improve the stakeholder performance. The empirical results found that the factors affecting socially responsible supply chain performance differed between the dual perspectives. From the firm's perspective, all three dimensions of social capital (shared values, communication and reciprocity) have a significant positive effect on socially responsible supply chain performance (income increase), while supply chain transparency only positively moderates between communication and income increase. From the farmers' perspective, only reciprocity and shared values had a significant positive effect on income increase; interestingly, supply chain transparency negatively moderated the relationship between reciprocity and income increase. This study expands the role of social capital theory, and the dual perspective examination provides insights for performance improvement of companies and farmers in socially responsible supply chains, as well as guidance for promoting sustainable social development."
37835104,Substance Use among Emerging Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Review through the Lens of Sustainable Development Goals.,"Public health initiatives, including lockdowns to reduce the spread of COVID-19, have resulted in societal stressors like loneliness, job loss, and economic collapse linked to worsening mental health outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, and coping-related substance use. The various psychosocial stressors caused by the pandemic have potentially led to the increased use of substances across the globe, particularly among emerging adults. The current study summarises the literature on substance use among emerging adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. The terms ""coronavirus"", ""COVID-19"", ""substance use"", ""substance abuse"", ""drug use"", drug abuse"", ""emerging adults"", and ""young adults"" were all used in different combinations throughout the search, using the Scopus, PubMed, and JSTOR databases. Using this method, a total of 28 English-language citations published between 2020 and 2023 were obtained. Following a study of the articles mentioned above, 16 papers were removed. The remaining 12 papers were included in this review. Even though substance use dropped when COVID-19 lockdowns began, it rose when restrictions were removed, particularly among those with prior substance use. Studies related to mental health need to assess substance use, as many emerging adults use substances to cope with distress, including isolation and loneliness, which are part of the current mental health crisis among emerging adults."
37833808,Mental health of South Korean adolescents in the COVID-19 Era: Web-based survey focused on suicide-related factors.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively impacted many aspects of life. Measures for preventing the spread of COVID-19 (e.g., school lockdowns, remote and hybrid classes, group and outdoor activity restrictions, and social distancing in the classroom and meal time) could have led to adolescents to experience anxiety and depressive symptoms. Such mental health impacts could increase the risk of suicidal ideation in this population. Moreover, according to a report by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, although the total number of suicide deaths in South Korea decreased in 2021, the suicide rate of those aged 10-29 years increased. One factor affecting the result is adolescent mental health by COVID-19. This study examines the mental health status of South Korean adolescents amid the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, and identifies and analyzes predictors of suicidal ideation, suicide planning, and suicide attempts."
37832720,Reverse genetics systems for SARS-CoV-2: Development and applications.,"The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused serious harm to human health and struck a blow to global economic development. Research on SARS-CoV-2 has greatly benefited from the use of reverse genetics systems, which have been established to artificially manipulate the viral genome, generating recombinant and reporter infectious viruses or biosafety level 2 (BSL-2)-adapted non-infectious replicons with desired modifications. These tools have been instrumental in studying the molecular biological characteristics of the virus, investigating antiviral therapeutics, and facilitating the development of attenuated vaccine candidates. Here, we review the construction strategies, development, and applications of reverse genetics systems for SARS-CoV-2, which may be applied to other CoVs as well."

37831729,Evaluation of coupling coordination development between digital economy and green finance: Evidence from 30 provinces in China.,"The convergence of China's digital economy and green finance holds great significance for fostering a sustainable and high-quality developmental path. However, existing studies have not explored the coupling coordination development between these two crucial subsystems. To bridge this gap, this paper employs a modified coupling coordination degree (CCD) model to assess and affirm the coupling coordination degree between the digital economy and green finance across 30 provinces in China from 2015-2021. Based on degree results, provinces are classified into three clusters by using K-means and hierarchical clustering algorithm. Our findings unveil that the current level of coupling coordination development in China is at a primary coordination stage. Although regional disparities significantly exist, the overall level of coordination remains steadily increasing, with the eastern region outperforming the western region. Additionally, we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic's disruption on the coupling coordination development of these systems has been limited. This research sheds light on the evolution of coupling systems and offers practical recommendations for strengthening the coordinated development of the digital economy and green finance."
37831727,Dynamic risk spillover effect and path of risk transmission across industrial sectors in China during COVID-19 epidemic.,"Understanding the dynamic link between the development of COVID-19 pandemic and industry sector risk spillovers is crucial to explore the underlying mechanisms by which major public health events affect economic systems. This paper applies ElasticNet method proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012, 2014) to estimate the dynamic risk spillover indicators of 20 industrial sectors in China from 2016 to 2022, and systematically examines the impact of industry risk network fluctuations and the transmission path caused by COVID-19 shock. The findings reveal that risk spillovers of Chinese industries show a dynamic change of ""decline-fluctuation-rebound"" with the three phases of COVID-19 epidemic. At the beginning of the epidemic, machinery and equipment, paper and printing, tourism and hotels, media and information services, and agriculture were the exporters of epidemic risk, while materials, transportation equipment, commercial trade, health care, and environmental protection were the importers of epidemic risk; However, as the epidemic developed further, the direction and effect of risk transmission in the industry was reversed. Examining the network characteristics of the pair sectors, we found that under the epidemic shock, the positive risk spillover from tourism and hotels, culture, education and sports to consumer goods, finance, and energy industries was significantly increased, and finance and real estate industries were affected by the risk impact of more industries, while the number of industries affected by information technology and computer industry was significantly reduced. This paper shows that there is inter-industry risk transmission of the COVID-19 epidemic shock, and the risk transmission feeds back in a cycle between industries as the epidemic develops, driving the economy into a vicious circle. The role of the service sector in blocking the spread of negative shocks from the epidemic should be emphasized and brought into play to avoid increasing the overall economic vulnerability. This study will help to deepen the understanding of scholars and policy makers on the network transmission effects of the epidemic."

37830779,Adapting to a global pandemic: a qualitative assessment of programmatic responses to COVID-19 in the multi-country Women's Integrated Sexual Health (WISH) programme.,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) globally but there is little published evidence on the COVID-19 response of SRHR programmes, or lessons learned through their adaptations. To document the COVID-19 response of a global SRHR programme (the Women's Integrated Sexual Health programme), in-depth interviews were conducted between April and July 2021 with 22 key informants from implementing partners in Sierra Leone, Ethiopia and central or regional offices, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the third-party monitoring partner. Framework analysis methods were used. Several rapid COVID-19 adaptations were identified: the development of crisis management and communication teams; increased partnership and engagement with government; reduced contact and risk in service delivery; reformulated community mobilisation; flexible performance management and remote methods of quality assurance; and sharing of learnings alongside the development of new guidance and tools. Throughout the pandemic, the programme was able to continue high-quality service delivery, though equity goals proved more difficult to reach. Challenges included the continually changing environment, competing pressures on governments, burdensome reporting, and staff burnout. The pandemic response was facilitated by prior experience of health emergencies, strong government relationships, a supportive workforce and some pre-existing approaches, tools, and systems. This study has identified important lessons that can inform programming in future crises, including the need for immediate recognition of SRHR as essential, sustained support for staff, use of multiple mechanisms to reach marginalised groups, adequate funding for equity goals, and a better balance between the burden of reporting and accountability needs."

37828094,CO,"Carbon Dioxide (CO[Formula: see text]) is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and one of the main drivers behind global warming and climate change. In spite of the global economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global average atmospheric CO[Formula: see text] concentration reached a new record high in 2020 with its year-on-year increase being the fifth highest annual increase in 63 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Furthermore, the years 2020 and 2019 were respectively the second and third warmest, while the decade 2010-2019 was the warmest decade ever recorded. In an attempt to curb this climate emergency, many countries and organizations globally have adopted ambitious goals and announced plans to help dramatically reduce CO[Formula: see text] emissions. As part of these plans, various innovative smart city projects are being developed, focusing on implementing Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. By collecting sensor-based data, such technologies aim towards automating data-driven decision-making around carbon emission management and reduction. In this work, a hybrid machine learning system, aimed at forecasting CO[Formula: see text] concentration levels in a smart city environment was developed using a multivariate time series dataset containing IoT sensor measurements of CO[Formula: see text], as well as various environmental factors, taken at every second. The proposed system demonstrated superior performance to similar methods, while also maintaining a high degree of interpretability. More specifically, the approach was empirically compared against other similar approaches in several scenarios and use cases, thus also offering more insight into the predictive capabilities of such state-of-the-art systems. For this comparison, both traditional time series and deep learning approaches were employed, including the current state-of-the-art architectures, such as attention-based, transformer networks. Results demonstrated that, when measured across various settings and metrics, including three different forecasting horizons, the hybrid solution achieved the best overall results, and in some cases, the difference in performance was statistically significant. At the same time, insights from the system's inner workings were extracted, shedding light on the reasoning behind the model's predictions and the factors that contribute to them, thus showcasing its transparency. Lastly, throughout the experiments, deep learning approaches illustrated their ability to better handle the multivariate nature of the dataset and in general tended to outperform the traditional time series methods, especially for longer forecasting horizons."

37824497,"COVID-19's shadow on families: A structural equation model of parental stress, family relationships, and child wellbeing.","The present study seeks to contribute to developmental science in emergencies by investigating associations between COVID-19 pandemic-related stressors, parents' stress, family relationships, and child wellbeing. In doing so, we build on recent research that generalizes the assumptions of the Family Stress Model beyond direct economic stressors of households to macro-contextual stressors that operate at the societal level. In the case of our study, these stressors relate to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as health risks and confinement-related stresses. Participants were 783 parents of young children (75% female, Mage = 34.61 years) residing in the United Arab Emirates. They completed an online survey in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, measuring how the pandemic impacted their lives and the lives of their child (Mage = 47.54 months). A subsample of parents (n = 96) completed the survey for two children. Structural equation modeling showed that pandemic-related stressors contributed to higher stress among parents which, in turn, resulted in lower parent-reported child wellbeing at various times during the pandemic. Family relationships mediated the association between parents' stress and child wellbeing. The present study contributes to our understanding on how large-scale disruption due to COVID-19 pandemic-related stressors gets inside the family, the strength and direction of associations (concurrently and over time), and the timing of mechanisms that impact family processes. The results highlight the need to support families with young children in managing disruptions due to emergencies, such as a global public health crisis, and to determine ways of preventing longstanding consequences on family structures and children's lives."

Although extensive work demonstrates inequities among Southeast Asian communities during the pandemic, much work categorizes Asians as one homogenous population neglecting the unique experiences of different Asian subgroups along with the ways COVID-19 differentially affects Southeast Asians. To attend to population variations, this paper explores the lived experiences among Vietnamese individuals during the pandemic in the Peel Region of Ontario Canada. Specifically, this paper examines social and economic impacts of COVID-19, access to healthcare services and vaccines, sources of vaccine information, and impacts of COVID-19 related discrimination among young and older adults. Drawing on in-depth interviews with young and older adults (n=6:8) the results reveal important social and economic impacts created by COVID-19 that vary across generations and impact health and wellbeing. These impacts are challenged further by barriers to healthcare access which were compounded by intersecting inequities experienced among Vietnamese immigrants in the Peel Region. While vaccine hesitancy was not a main concern, the findings demonstrate important generational differences with respect to commonly used and trusted information related to historical events and social media use. Although racial discrimination was a dominant concern, younger participants did not feel unsafe but expressed concern for the safety of their older family members and friends. The study underscores the need to consider historical dynamics and the ways they shape government opinions and trust, experiences of racial discrimination and socio-economic realities among racialized, immigrant populations."
37821316,Nonclinical safety assessment and immunogenicity of rVSVInd(GML)-mspSGtc vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 in rabbits.,"The worldwide health, economic, and societal consequences of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have been devastating. The primary strategy to prevent new infectious diseases is to vaccinate the majority of people worldwide. However, the significant hurdles that are faced include vaccine safety concerns and vaccine reluctance. Among the various types of vaccines, the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) is a promising candidate owing to its safety and efficacy. Therefore, we investigated the toxicity, immunogenicity, and local tolerance of the rVSVInd(GML)-mspSGtc vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits were administered single or three repeated intramuscular injections of rVSVInd(GML)-mspSGtc every 2 weeks, followed by a 4-week recovery period. Male and female rabbits were randomly assigned into three groups: a control group and two dose-level groups (1 × 10"
37821163,"Think global, act local: using a translocal approach to understand community-based organisations' responses to planetary health crises during COVID-19.","Little is known on how community-based responses to planetary health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can integrate concerns about livelihoods, equity, health, wellbeing, and the environment. We used a translocal learning approach to co-develop insights on community-based responses to complex health and environmental and economic crises with leaders from five organisations working with communities at the front line of intersecting planetary health challenges in Finland, India, Kenya, Peru, and the USA. Translocal learning supports collective knowledge production across different localities in ways that value local perspectives but transcend national boundaries. There were three main findings from the translocal learning process. First, thanks to their proximity to the communities they served, community-based organisations (CBOs) can quickly identify the ways in which COVID-19 might worsen existing social and health inequities. Second, localised CBO actions are key to supporting communities with unique challenges in the face of systemic planetary health crises. Third, CBOs can develop rights-based, ecologically-minded actions responding to local priorities and mobilising available resources. Our findings show how solutions to planetary health might come from small-scale community initiatives that are well connected within and across contexts. Locally-focused globally-aware actions should be harnessed through greater recognition, funding, and networking opportunities. Globally, planetary health initiatives should be supported by applying the principles of subsidiarity and translocalism."
37821092,Trajectories of financial distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and their associations with mental health and substance use outcomes in a cohort of young adults.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented life disruptions among young adults, including increased job insecurity and financial strain. Mental health problems and substance use have also increased during the pandemic, with young adults particularly vulnerable to experiencing these challenges. This study examines trajectories of financial distress among young adults during the pandemic and their associations with depression, anxiety, and hazardous alcohol and cannabis use. Data from 473 young adults (ages 22-29) recruited in the Northwest United States were collected from April/May 2020 to July/August 2021. Financial distress trajectories were identified using growth mixture modeling. Negative binomial models were used to examine associations between financial distress trajectories and distal outcomes of depression, anxiety, alcohol, and cannabis use. Three distinct trajectories were identified, revealing Low, Moderate, and High financial distress experiences. Individuals with ""Moderate"" and ""High"" trajectories showed significantly greater depressive and anxiety symptom scores compared with those in the ""Low"" financial distress trajectory group. Trajectories were not associated with subsequent levels of alcohol or cannabis use. Young adult mental health remains a priority during periods of economic downturn. Providers must be aware of the psychological challenges imposed by financial distress among young adults to address worsening mental health symptoms."
37820496,Contending with precarity: Digital pathways to sexual and reproductive healthcare among transgender Filipinos during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Stringent lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic and the cisnormative framing of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) in the Philippines cultivated precarious access to SRH systems among transgender (trans) communities during the public health crisis. With the shift toward digital health initiatives, this study aimed to explore the experiences of the local trans community in using digital health initiatives (DHIs) to access SRH care and gender-affirming services, information, and providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Online interviews with 13 self-identified trans Filipinos living in the Philippines during the pandemic were conducted and analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. First, the narratives of trans Filipinos illustrate how DHIs can address discontinuities of care that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, because of long-standing geographic, economic, and social barriers to trans-responsive healthcare in the Philippines, local trans communities navigate alternative pathways to care established within digital spaces (e.g., social media) by trans individuals and groups. These online communities of care not only connect trans Filipinos to culturally competent and affordable care but also foster a sense of belongingness and support. Taken together, this study underscores the need to go beyond technical access to care to ensure that trans-inclusive and trans-responsive sources and providers of care are made available throughout the healthcare system. As the narratives of trans Filipinos illustrate, the narratives, experiences, and practices within their online communities of care may be the key to actualizing such a healthcare system not only in the Philippines but all over the world."

37813442,Scaling up food pricing policies in the Pacific: a guide to action.,"There are calls for governments around the world to adopt pricing policies, including taxes, subsidies and price controls that ensure all people have access to, and can afford, healthy diets. Despite the strong potential of pricing policies to promote healthy diets and to support a post-COVID-19 recovery, there are gaps in evidence with regard to 'how' to design and apply effective food taxes in practice, and countries report challenges in navigating the different policy options.In this practice piece, we examine the global evidence for food taxes with a view to identifying practical lessons for policy design, adoption and implementation, using the Pacific Islands Region as a case study. We present a systematic resource that draws on locally generated evidence, and a Pacific conceptualisation of healthy diets, to address considerations in setting the tax base, rate and mechanisms, and to ensure tax targets are clearly identifiable within national tax and administrative systems. Health and Finance collaboration at the country level could ensure tax design addresses concerns for the impacts of food taxes on employment, economics and equity, as well as position food taxes as an opportunity to fund revenue shortfalls faced by governments following the COVID-19 pandemic. We demonstrate a need to review other policies for consistency with national health objectives to ensure that countries avoid inadvertently undermining health taxes, for example, by ensuring that foods with known non-communicable disease risk are not being price protected or promoted."

37817302,A low burden of severe illness: the COVID-19 Omicron outbreak in the remote Torres and Cape region of Far North Queensland.,"A coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was declared in the remote Torres and Cape region of Far North Queensland soon after the Queensland border opened for quarantine-free domestic travel in December 2021, with a total of 7,784 cases notified during the first ten-month outbreak period. We report a crude attack rate among residents of 25.6% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 25.1-26.1%), a hospitalisation rate of 1.6% (95% CI: 1.3-1.9%) and a crude case fatality rate of 0.05% (95% CI: 0.01-0.13%). Hospitalisation and case fatality rates were similar among First Nations and non-Indigenous people, with double dose COVID-19 vaccination rates higher among First Nations than non-Indigenous people by the end of the outbreak period. We attribute the low burden of severe illness to local community leadership, community engagement, vaccination coverage and recency, and community participation in a local culturally considered COVID-19 care-in-the-home program."

37815753,The Present and Future Aspects of Life-Long Pertussis Prevention: Narrative Review with Regional Perspectives for Türkiye.,"Pertussis, caused by Bordetella pertussis, remains one of the most widespread, contagious, and vaccine-preventable diseases. It results in notable morbidity and mortality as well as severe medical, social, and economic burden. Despite high global vaccine coverage, pertussis continues to be a significant epidemiologic problem, with outbreak episodes every few years just as in the pre-vaccination era. In Türkiye, there is a lack of comprehensive data on the current burden of pertussis in different age and risk groups, leading to underdiagnosis and underreporting of the disease, especially in adults who are often not considered at risk. Available data from Türkiye also reveal inadequate levels of protective antibodies in preterm newborns, emphasizing the need for additional preventive measures. Authors stated that improving physician awareness of pertussis symptoms in patients with prolonged cough, increasing access to routine pertussis tests, and conducting surveillance studies would aid in accurate diagnosis and reporting in Türkiye. As the Turkish Ministry of Health Antenatal Care Management Guide suggests routine second and third pregnancy check-up visits at weeks 18-24 and 28-32 correspondingly, this period can be considered the ideal vaccination time for Türkiye. Introducing a booster dose of Tdap at around 10 years of age or during national military service would reduce transmission and protect susceptible individuals. Identifying individuals at high risk of severe pertussis and prioritizing them for a booster dose is also crucial in Türkiye. Enhancing surveillance systems, increasing healthcare professionals' awareness through training, and organizing catch-up visits for missed vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic are mentioned as additional strategies to improve pertussis prevention in Türkiye. This review focuses on the global and regional burden of pertussis and obstacles to effective prevention and evaluates existing strategies to achieve lifelong pertussis prevention. Literature and current strategies were also discussed from a Turkish national standpoint."

These global crises affect young people in a particularly vulnerable phase of their lives. The current study aimed to assess the impact of these crises on mental health (depression, anxiety, and health-related quality of life) in secondary school students in Germany. Furthermore, we assessed known predictors of mental health, such as socio-economic factors, individual life stressors, and resilience factors (self-efficacy, expressive flexibility) as covariates. In our sample of 3998 pupils, pandemic- and climate-related distress were linked to greater depression and anxiety and reduced health-related quality of life. War-related distress was associated with greater anxiety. Critically, these associations remained significant after controlling for all covariates, supporting the incremental predictive value of the crises measures. The study reveals a significant impact of the crises on the mental health of the current generation of adolescents. As such it suggests that mental health policies should include interventions that help youth to cope with the stress caused by the crises."

37811981,Inference and forecasting phase shift regime of COVID-19 sub-lineages with a Markov-switching model.,"The occurrences and domination of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants are still crucial factors for determining the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) policies. We collected weekly Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak sub-lineages, naming genetically distinct lineages of SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern, in the United Kingdom, South Africa, South Korea, Denmark, Germany, the United States, and worldwide. This study included 12,296,756 samples of the max share of the sub-lineages from the 33rd week of 2020 to the 40th week of 2022. This study conducted a two-state Markov-switching model to estimate the probability of the phase shift state and predicted the probability of each regime with the Hamilton filter and Kim's smoothing algorithm. We discovered different weekly patterns based on dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants in target area. Due to differences in containment policies and outbreak waves, we observed a time lag in dominant variants in these countries. Using the inferred probability of the phase shift regime for forecasting, it showed significant probabilities that the stable phase will still be stable in the next week. It also showed significant probabilities that the unstable phase will still be unstable in the next week. Our findings present the probability of observing the phase shift regime each week. Until a new SARS-CoV-2 variant occurs, the regime tended to stay with a low probability of phase shift regime. When a new SARS-CoV-2 variant would occur, the regime would immediately react and change the probability. We propose the Markov-switching model to determine COVID-19 policies and predict SARS-CoV-2 variants. IMPORTANCE Using regime-switching models, we attempted to determine whether there is a link between changes in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) variants and infection waves, as well as forecasting new SARS-Cov-2 variants. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the field because it proposes a new approach for forecasting the ongoing pandemic, and the spread of other infectious diseases, using a statistical model which incorporates unpredictable factors such as human behavior, political factors, and cultural beliefs."

The rapid review was published when little was known about transmission, treatment or future vaccination, and when physical distancing measures (isolation, quarantine, contact tracing, crowd avoidance, work and school measures) were the cornerstone of public health responses globally. This updated review includes more recent evidence to extend what we know about effective pandemic public health communication. This includes considerations of changes needed over time to maintain responsiveness to pandemic transmission waves, the (in)equities and variable needs of groups within communities due to the pandemic, and highlights again the critical role of effective communication as integral to the public health response."
37811599,"The Costs of Polarizing a Pandemic: Antecedents, Consequences, and Lessons.","Polarization has been rising in the United States of America for the past few decades and now poses a significant-and growing-public-health risk. One of the signature features of the American response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the degree to which perceptions of risk and willingness to follow public-health recommendations have been politically polarized. Although COVID-19 has proven more lethal than any war or public-health crisis in American history, the deadly consequences of the pandemic were exacerbated by polarization. We review research detailing how every phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has been polarized, including judgments of risk, spatial distancing, mask wearing, and vaccination. We describe the role of political ideology, partisan identity, leadership, misinformation, and mass communication in this public-health crisis. We then assess the overall impact of polarization on infections, illness, and mortality during the pandemic; offer a psychological analysis of key policy questions; and identify a set of future research questions for scholars and policy experts. Our analysis suggests that the catastrophic death toll in the United States was largely preventable and due, in large part, to the polarization of the pandemic. Finally, we discuss implications for public policy to help avoid the same deadly mistakes in future public-health crises."

Using rent theory to understand the restructuring of publicly funded seniors' care in British Columbia, Canada.","Crises of seniors' care in countries like the UK and Canada, further highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, have been connected to processes of privatization and financialization. In this paper I argue that rent theory is important for disaggregating mechanisms, including of accumulation by dispossession, the devaluation of labour, and assetization, that underpin the process of financialization in the sector. Work on rents often divides between critical approaches, especially to land rent, and mainstream institutionalist and public choice approaches to rent-seeking. Critical rent theory is evolving beyond this divide to understand a broader range of types of rent. Yet, despite attention to the increasing importance of economic rents and forms of rentierism, labour and social reproduction are often excluded from the analysis of how rent relations arise. This paper demonstrates the problems with these exclusions. The argument is illustrated through an analysis of the restructuring of eldercare in British Columbia, Canada, in the last two decades, and employs a feminist political economy approach to examine the social production of rent relations."
37810858,COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Wave-centric assessments and mitigation measures for future pandemics.,"The ongoing pandemic COVID-19 caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has wreaked havoc globally by affecting millions of lives. Although different countries found the implementation of emergency measures useful to combat the viral pandemic, many countries are still experiencing the resurgence of COVID-19 cases with new variants even after following strict containment guidelines. Country-specific lessons learned from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic can be utilized in commencing a successful battle against the potential future outbreaks. In this article, we analyzed the overall scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh from Alpha to Omicron variant and discussed the demographic, political, economic, social, and environmental influences on the mitigation strategies employed by the country to combat the pandemic. We also tried to explore the preparedness and precautionary measures taken by the responsible authorities, the choice of strategies implemented, and the effectiveness of the response initiated by the government and relevant agencies. Finally, we discussed the possible strategies that might help Bangladesh to combat future COVID-19 waves and other possible pandemics based on the experiences gathered from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic."

37810046,Work from home practices as corporate strategy- an integrative review.,"The Covid 19 pandemic led to major changes at the individual, organisational and institutional levels of policy, productive functions, and organising. During Covid 19 morbidity, public institutions enforced social isolation, mandatory self-isolation, quarantines, and administrative regulatory lockdowns, which led to a movement away from the physical, material world and into an all-consuming digital universe. With growing interest in work-from-home (WFH) opportunities, this article provides an integrative review of 107 papers. It comprises the bibliometric analysis and manual review of the articles, on the basis of which we present an elaborative discussion and agenda for future research. According to the analysis, WFH looks a tad of a double-edged sword in that it may have major but unintended repercussions for institutions, and organizations as well as hidden, positive as well as negative consequences for individuals/employees. One of the significant insight from our analysis was the absence of HR function's strategic or operational input or oversight during corporate WFH strategies. We suggest several theoretical frameworks for further developing, theorizing, and empirically testing various aspects of WFH. Further, we recognise that WFH is becoming increasingly visible as a result of the pandemic scenario and significant technical advancements, which must be reflected in the research. Finally, because WFH represents a significant disruption in how organizations produce work and manage it, we propose employee and managerial consequences as future research agendas."

Against a backdrop of loosely enforced food laws and regulations, a cross-sectional study was carried out in 23 Lebanese food companies on 204 participants using a validated online food safety culture self-assessment tool consisting of 28 indicators. Food safety motivation, burnout/job stress and conscientiousness and their impact on food safety culture were also investigated. Overall, the perceived food safety culture was ""good"" with a mean value of 119.1 over 140 (equivalent to 4.3/5). A young workforce, the female gender, a science background, and a university degree were associated with a higher food safety culture. The food safety culture score was also perceived higher among participants who attended food safety trainings, and among those working at the managerial level and in the quality department. In addition, the results showed that the food safety culture was significantly better in companies exporting their goods than companies with no international market exposure (121.6 vs 118.1). Moreover, Food safety motivation (mean score 4.1/5) and conscientiousness (3.5/5) were moderately associated with a positive food safety culture. However, the low burnout/job stress scores (2.8/5) may exhibit a negative impact on the food safety culture and could be related to several consequences caused by the Lebanese economic crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. Further studies are to be conducted to understand better the causal effects relationship."

Considering the increasing number of Muslim populations worldwide and the necessity of online applications during health crises, this research aims to study the consumer's purchase intention of halal health supplement products online by examining variables influencing consumer's purchase intention. The Theory of Planned Behaviour has been applied as an underlying theory for this study, including religiosity and COVID-19 as an extension to the theory. 214 respondents participated in this study by completing the survey questionnaire via an online platform. Analysis was performed using SmartPLS4. The findings illustrate that perceived benefit is the most important indicator for Indonesian respondents, while attitude, subjective norms, and the COVID-19 pandemic are the factors that contribute to purchase intention among Malaysian respondents. The study enhances current literature, specifically in the context of halal health supplement products. Additionally, investigating the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of halal health supplements with a unique set of variables leads to a new path of study. Examining consumer behavior such as perceived benefit, attitude, subjective norms, and the COVID-19 pandemic that influence online purchase intention will provide consumer insights to marketers involved in halal health supplement products. The perspective on consumer beliefs gives directions for strategy development to businesses."
37809592,Accelerating discovery: A novel flow cytometric method for detecting fibrin(ogen) amyloid microclots using long COVID as a model.,"Long COVID has become a significant global health and economic burden, yet there are currently no established methods or diagnostic tools to identify which patients might benefit from specific treatments. One of the major pathophysiological factors contributing to Long COVID is the presence of hypercoagulability; this results in insoluble amyloid microclots that are resistant to fibrinolysis. Our previous research using fluorescence microscopy has demonstrated a significant amyloid microclot load in Long COVID patients. However, this approach lacked the elements of statistical robustness, objectivity, and rapid throughput. In the current study, we have used imaging flow cytometry for the first time to show a significantly increased concentration and size of these microclots. We identified notable variations in size and fluorescence between microclots in Long COVID and those of controls even using a 20× objective. By combining cell imaging and the high-event-rate and full-sample analysis nature of a conventional flow cytometer, imaging flow cytometry can eliminate erroneous results and increase accuracy in gating and analysis beyond what pure quantitative measurements from conventional flow cytometry can provide. Although imaging flow cytometry was used in our study, our results suggest that the signals indicating the presence of microclots should be easily detectable using a conventional flow cytometer. Flow cytometry is a more widely available technique than fluorescence microscopy and has been used in pathology laboratories for decades, rendering it a potentially more suitable and accessible method for detecting microclots in individuals suffering from Long COVID or conditions with similar pathology, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis."
37809547,Construction of influencing factors model for public information avoidance behavior in major infectious disease outbreaks based on meta-ethnography.,"Major infectious disease outbreaks are highly susceptible to diffuse outbreaks due to their sudden and more widespread nature. Compared to previous outbreaks such as the Spanish flu and SARS in China, COVID-19 has greatly affected the health of citizens and the economic development of countries worldwide, and is representative of major infectious disease outbreaks in many ways. Information avoidance, a common information behaviour during major infectious disease outbreaks, can alleviate the stress caused by information overload as a strategy to reduce negative emotions and maintain optimism. However, it can also bias risk perceptions and avoid content of greater value. Therefore, a deeper understanding of public information behaviour, particularly how and why relevant information is circumvented, places a demand on researchers."
37809530,Adapting to change: Exploring reverse migration as a coping strategy among internal migrants in Bangladesh.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has slowed down economic growth and disrupted labor markets throughout the world, including Bangladesh. A significant proportion of people lost income sources in the formal and informal sectors, triggering them to return to villages, and the transition introduces us to the new phenomenon known as ""reverse migration"". This study explores and synthesizes the COVID-19 induced changing patterns of migration and returnees' coping strategies based on their level of preparedness as well as resource mobilization. A mixed-method research approach was applied to conduct the research. The study area was Rangpur (Pirganj, Taraganj, and Kaunia). For collecting primary data, semi-structured survey questionnaires were used and conducted 84 field survey data, 12 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), 6 In-Depth Interviews (IDIs), 2 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs), and participant observations. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis with the assistance of NVivo software were used to present the findings of this study. The findings of the study revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic fueled informal job holders' returning to their homeland due to a low level of preparedness and mobilized resources. The study found that most respondents were in severe level unemployment. As a result, a lack of physical assets, they could not start new income-generating ventures and encountered food insecurity due to unexpected price hikes. The alarming result indicates that internal reverse migration is gendered, and the adverse impact is more prevalent among female migrants rather than male migrants. Along with the governmental organizations, the highlights of this study would be essential for non-governmental organizations and development practitioners."
37809491,Spatiotemporal pattern evolution and influencing factors of online public opinion--Evidence from the early-stage of COVID-19 in China.,"With the rapid development of internet information technology, online public opinion's influence is infinitely magnified, seriously threatening social security and national governance. It is significant to clarify the spatial and temporal evolution rules of online public opinion on major epidemics and its influencing factors for the governance and guidance of online public opinion on major epidemics. In this paper, the spatiotemporal evolution analysis model of online public opinion and an analysis model of influencing factors were constructed. We selected the Baidu index and microblog crawler text data at the early stage of COVID-19 as the research objects and analyzed the evolution of online public opinion during the time period by using the optimal segmentation method, spatial autocorrelation analysis, and text analysis method. The spatiotemporal evolutionary influences and their influence are further analyzed using the geographic probe factor detection method. The results showed that the evolution of online public opinion in the early stage of the epidemic was closely related to the event's evolution and the prevention and control effect. In the time dimension, the early evolution of online public opinion has prominent periodic characteristics. In the geospatial dimension, there are significant spatial agglomeration effects and spillover effects. In the cyberspace dimension, there are significant differences in online public opinion heat, hot topics, and netizens' emotional tendencies at different stages. Furthermore, the severity of the epidemic, the number of Internet users, the number of media reports and the region's attributes jointly affect the spatial and temporal evolution pattern of online public opinions about the epidemic. The research results provide decision-making references for the government and planners to effectively manage online public opinion on emergencies and improve the government's public opinion governance capacity and level."

The unequal conditions of public health systems also increase the infection rate and make early identification and treatment of at-risk patients difficult. Here, we aimed to characterize the epidemiological profile of COVID-19 patients in intensive care and identify laboratory and clinical markers associated with death."
37808938,Resources and transversal competencies to reconcile child and parental responsibilities: A mini-review of the impact of COVID-19 on the Italian sandwich generation.,"Longer life spans and the delayed economic and psychological independence of children mean that middle-aged parents find themselves caring for parents and children at the same period in their lives, at times this care may extend to grandchildren and grandparents. The type of care varies depending on each person's need but also on the gender of the individual who looks after their parents while taking care of their own children. Cultural factors can also come into play. Complications in the lives of those who are part of the Sandwich Generation (SG) may arise affecting the quality of their time, their psyche, physical and financial situation. Having the necessary skills and strategies to cope with these complications is extremely important."

The purpose of this study was to examine how these changes affected the experiences of LGBTQ+ parents in the UK."
37803142,The contribution of risk perception and social norms to reported preventive behaviour against selected vector-borne diseases in Guyana.,"Preventing vector-borne diseases (VBDs) mainly relies on effective vector control tools and strategies, which in turn depend on population acceptance and adherence. Inspired by the abundant recent literature on SARS-COV-2, we investigate the relationship between risk perception and preventive behaviour for selected VBDs and the extent to which risk perception is determined by social norms. We use cross-sectional data collected from 497 individuals in four regions of Guyana in 2017. We use a conditional mixed process estimator with multilevel coefficients, estimated through a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) framework, applying a simultaneous equation structure. We find robust results on malaria: risk perception was significantly influenced by the risk perception of the reference group across different definitions of the reference group, hinting at the existence of social norms. Risk perception significantly increased the likelihood of passive behaviour by 4.48%. Less clear-cut results were found for dengue. This study applies quantitative social science methods to public health issues in the context of VBDs. Our findings point to the relevance of tailoring communications on health risks for VBDs to groups defined at the intersection of socio-economic and demographic characteristics. Such tailored strategies are expected to align risk perception among reference groups and boost preventive behaviour."
37803048,COVID-19 pandemic stressors are associated with reported increases in frequency of drunkenness among individuals with a history of alcohol use disorder.,"Some sources report increases in alcohol use have been observed since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among women. Cross-sectional studies suggest that specific COVID-19-related stressful experiences (e.g., social disconnection) may be driving such increases in the general population. Few studies have explored these topics among individuals with a history of Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD), an especially vulnerable population. Drawing on recent data collected by the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA; COVID-19 study N = 1651, 62% women, age range: 30-91) in conjunction with AUD history data collected on the sample since 1990, we investigated associations of COVID-19 related stressors and coping activities with changes in drunkenness frequency since the start of the pandemic. Analyses were conducted for those without a history of AUD (N: 645) and three groups of participants with a history of AUD prior to the start of the pandemic: (1) those experiencing AUD symptoms (N: 606), (2) those in remission who were drinking (N: 231), and (3) those in remission who were abstinent (had not consumed alcohol for 5+ years; N: 169). Gender-stratified models were also examined. Exploratory analyses examined the moderating effects of 'problematic alcohol use' polygenic risk scores (PRS) and neural connectivity (i.e., posterior interhemispheric alpha EEG coherence) on associations between COVID-19 stressors and coping activities with changes in the frequency of drunkenness. Increases in drunkenness frequency since the start of the pandemic were higher among those with a lifetime AUD diagnosis experiencing symptoms prior to the start of the pandemic (14% reported increased drunkenness) when compared to those without a history of AUD (5% reported increased drunkenness). Among individuals in remission from AUD prior to the start of the pandemic, rates of increased drunkenness were 10% for those who were drinking pre-pandemic and 4% for those who had previously been abstinent. Across all groups, women reported nominally greater increases in drunkenness frequency when compared with men, although only women experiencing pre-pandemic AUD symptoms reported significantly greater rates of increased drunkenness since the start of the pandemic compared to men in this group (17% of women vs. 5% of men). Among those without a prior history of AUD, associations between COVID-19 risk and protective factors with increases in drunkenness frequency were not observed. Among all groups with a history of AUD (including those with AUD symptoms and those remitted from AUD), perceived stress was associated with increases in drunkenness. Among the remitted-abstinent group, essential worker status was associated with increases in drunkenness. Gender differences in these associations were observed: among women in the remitted-abstinent group, essential worker status, perceived stress, media consumption, and decreased social interactions were associated with increases in drunkenness. Among men in the remitted-drinking group, perceived stress was associated with increases in drunkenness, and increased relationship quality was associated with decreases in drunkenness. Exploratory analyses indicated that associations between family illness or death with increases in drunkenness and increased relationship quality with decreases in drunkenness were more pronounced among the remitted-drinking participants with higher PRS. Associations between family illness or death, media consumption, and economic hardships with increases in drunkenness and healthy coping with decreases in drunkenness were more pronounced among the remitted-abstinent group with lower interhemispheric alpha EEG connectivity. Our results demonstrated that only individuals with pre-pandemic AUD symptoms reported greater increases in drunkenness frequency since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to those without a lifetime history of AUD. This increase was more pronounced among women than men in this group. However, COVID-19-related stressors and coping activities were associated with changes in the frequency of drunkenness among all groups of participants with a prior history of AUD, including those experiencing AUD symptoms, as well as abstinent and non-abstinent participants in remission. Perceived stress, essential worker status, media consumption, social connections (especially for women), and relationship quality (especially for men) are specific areas of focus for designing intervention and prevention strategies aimed at reducing pandemic-related alcohol misuse among this particularly vulnerable group. Interestingly, these associations were not observed for individuals without a prior history of AUD, supporting prior literature that demonstrates that widespread stressors (e.g., pandemics, terrorist attacks) disproportionately impact the mental health and alcohol use of those with a prior history of problems."
37803040,Uncover a microbiota signature of upper respiratory tract in patients with SARS-CoV-2 + .,"The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, forced us to face a pandemic with unprecedented social, economic, and public health consequences. Several nations have launched campaigns to immunize millions of people using various vaccines to prevent infections. Meanwhile, therapeutic approaches and discoveries continuously arise; however, identifying infected patients that are going to experience the more severe outcomes of COVID-19 is still a major need, to focus therapeutic efforts, reducing hospitalization and mitigating drug adverse effects. Microbial communities colonizing the respiratory tract exert significant effects on host immune responses, influencing the susceptibility to infectious agents. Through 16S rDNAseq we characterized the upper airways' microbiota of 192 subjects with nasopharyngeal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients were divided into groups based on the presence of symptoms, pneumonia severity, and need for oxygen therapy or intubation. Indeed, unlike most of the literature, our study focuses on identifying microbial signatures predictive of disease progression rather than on the probability of infection itself, for which a consensus is lacking. Diversity, differential abundance, and network analysis at different taxonomic levels were synergistically adopted, in a robust bioinformatic pipeline, highlighting novel possible taxa correlated with patients' disease progression to intubation."
37802646,Asymmetric nexus between pandemic uncertainty and public health spendings: Evidence from quantile estimation.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide, prompting governments to allocate substantial resources toward public health spendings (PHS). However, the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic have raised questions about the effectiveness and sustainability of such expenditures. This research analyzes the nonlinear link between pandemic uncertainty (PNU) and PHS in countries with highest PNU (USA, India, France, Germany, UK, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Indonesia, Japan, and China). Previous studies have employed panel data methodologies to establish consistent findings regarding the relationship between pandemics and health spendings, regardless of the fact that several countries have not autonomously recognized this connection. In contrast, this current research adopts a distinctive tool called ""quantile-on-quantile,"" which enables the examination of time series dependency within each economy, providing both international and country-specific perspectives on the relationship between the variables. The estimations indicate that PNU leads to an increase in PHS in the vast majority of economies chosen by us, focusing on definite segments of the data distribution. Moreover, the data demonstrates that there are differences in the asymmetry between the variables across various nations. This underscores the need for policymakers to take careful deliberation when formulating policies related to health spendings and addressing the challenges posed by pandemic uncertainty."

Therefore, to increase health system efficiency and reduce HIV-associated mortality, in November, 2018, the Ministry of Health launched national guidelines on implementing eight differentiated service delivery models (DSDMs) for HIV treatment. We assessed the effect of this implementation on retention in ART 12 months after initiation, and explored the associated effects of COVID-19."

37801724,Social determinants of mental health among older adolescent girls living in urban informal settlements in Kenya and Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The health burden due to mental health has historically been underestimated with focus on communicable diseases and deaths and little consideration of disability and comorbidity effects of poor mental health. Recent data show increasing trends of mental health disorders as a share of global health burdens and vulnerability of adolescents. This paper aims to explore social determinants of mental health as experienced by adolescent girls, drawing attention to gendered risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews with twenty-two adolescent girls in urban informal settlements in Kenya and Nigeria reveal unique environmental, socio-cultural, economic and educational factors that threatened their mental wellbeing. The pandemic exacerbated these determinants. An equitable recovery will require a consideration of not only disproportional mental health outcomes, but also social determinants that contribute to these outcomes. As more than half of the urban population in sub-Saharan Africa reside in informal settlements, this study has implications for youth-focused mental health interventions in these and similar settings."
37801722,',"COVID-19 prevention measures including lockdowns, school closures, and restricted movement disrupted young people's lives. This longitudinal qualitative study conducted in Soweto, South Africa aimed to explore young people's knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19, vaccination, and the impact of infections. A convenience sample of 30 young black people (n = 15 men; n = 15 women, aged 16-21 years) from Soweto participated in 24 focus group discussions (FGDs), conducted in six phases - each phase had four FGDs stratified by gender and age. Young people's understanding of COVID-19 deepened throughout the study, however, did not always translate into adherence (following the government's COVID-19 prevention measures). Although deemed inadequate, TV and radio were preferred over internet COVID-19 information. Parents, teachers, and schools were trusted sources of information. Vaccines and limited access to information attributed to low-risk perception, while new COVID-19 variants attributed to high-risk perception. A low-risk perception and conspiracy theories contributed to non-adherence (disregarding COVID-19 preventative measures provided by the government), particularly among young men. Accessing reliable information that considers young people's lives and their living context is important. Communities, scientists, and policymakers must learn from the COVID-19 experience and implement localised preventive strategies for education, awareness, and economic support in future emergencies."

37801299,"Intrinsic factors behind long-COVID: II. SARS-CoV-2, extracellular vesicles, and neurological disorders.","With the decline in the number of new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, the World Health Organization announced the end of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, the repercussions of this viral pandemic may remain with us for a longer period of time, as it has remodeled the lives of humankind in many ways, including social and economic. Of course, its most important repercussions remain on the human health level. Long-coronavirus disease (COVID) or post-COVID is a state for which we do not have a concrete definition, a specific international classification of diseases Code, clear diagnostic tools, or well-known effective cures as of yet. In this second article from the Intrinsic Factors behind long-COVID Series, we try to link long-COVID symptoms with their causes, starting from the nervous system. Extracellular vesicles (ECVs) play very complex and ramified roles in the bodies of both healthy and not-healthy individuals. ECVs may facilitate the entry of many bioactive molecules and pathogens into the tissues and cells of the nervous system across the blood-brain barrier. Based on the size, quantity, and quality of their cargo, ECVs are directly proportional to the pathological condition and its severity through intertwined mechanisms that evoke inflammatory immune responses typically accompanied by pathological symptoms over variable time periods according to the type of these symptoms."

37799056,Racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 diagnosis and adherence to mitigation behaviours in a national United States older adult sample.,"Older adults and people of colour are vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic, and mitigation behaviours reduce COVID-19 infection. We examined racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 diagnosis and adherence to COVID-19 mitigation behaviours among U.S. older adults. Data were retrieved from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, a nationally representative prospective cohort with 3257 U.S. Medicare beneficiaries aged 65+. COVID-19 variables were collected in 2020; all other data in 2019. Odds of COVID-19 diagnosis and adherence to mitigation behaviours (handwashing, masking, social distancing) were analysed using logistic regression. Compared to White older adults, only Hispanic respondents had 2.7 times significantly higher odds of COVID-19 after adjusting for sociodemographics, health, and mitigation behaviours (aOR = 2.71, 95% CI = 1.20-6.12). Black older adults had 7.9 times significantly higher odds of masking (aOR = 7.94, 95% CI = 2.33-27.04) and 2.3 times higher odds of social distancing (aOR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.28-4.24), after adjusting for sociodemographics and health. Among all racial and ethnic groups, only Hispanic older adults had a significantly elevated COVID-19 diagnosis. Despite higher adherence to COVID-19 mitigation behaviours among racial and ethnic minorities, especially Black older adults, odds of COVID-19 remained elevated. Research is needed to explore potential mechanisms for higher odds of COVID-19 among minority older adults."
37798271,On the determinants of anti-COVID restriction and anti-vaccine movements: the case of IoApro in Italy.,"Following restrictions to control the spread of COVID-19, and subsequent vaccination campaigns, sentiments against such policies were quick to arise. While individual-level determinants that led to such attitudes have drawn much attention, there are also reasons to believe that the macro context in which these movements arose may contribute to their evolution. In this study, exploiting data on business activities which supported a major Italian anti-restriction and anti-vaccine movement, IoApro, using quantitative analysis that employs both a fractional response probit and logit model and a beta regression model, we investigate the relationship between socio-economic characteristics, institutional quality, and the flourishing of this movement. Our results suggest a U-shaped relationship between income and the proliferation of the movement, meaning that support for these movements increases the greater the degree of economic decline. Our results further indicate that the share of the population between 40 and 60 years old is positively related to support for such movements, as is institutional corruption."

In the light of global population ageing, the prevalence of frailty is expected to soar in coming decades. This narrative review provides critical insights into recent developments and emerging practices in frailty research regarding identification, management, risk factors, and prevention. We searched journals in the top two quartiles of geriatrics and gerontology (from Clarivate Journal Citation Reports) for articles published between 01 January 2018 and 20 December 2022. Several recent developments were identified, including new biomarkers and biomarker panels for frailty screening and diagnosis, using artificial intelligence to identify frailty, and investigating the altered response to medications by older adults with frailty. Other areas with novel developments included exercise (including technology-based exercise), multidimensional interventions, person-centred and integrated care, assistive technologies, analysis of frailty transitions, risk-factors, clinical guidelines, COVID-19, and potential future treatments. This review identified a strong need for the implementation and evaluation of cost-effective, community-based interventions to manage and prevent frailty. Our findings highlight the need to better identify and support older adults with frailty and involve those with frailty in shared decision-making regarding their care."

37797543,Believing in conspiracy theories in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic: Drivers and public health implications.,"Conspiracy theories jeopardize public health by disseminating misinformation and undermining authoritative health guidelines. This study explores social factors associated with the belief in conspiracy theories in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing upon the theoretical framework of Max Weber, it posits that beliefs in conspiracy theories are linked to both instrumental rationality considerations, such as trust in health authorities, science, and pharmaceutical companies, as well as value-rationality based factors, such as ideological orientation. The study analyzes recent, nationally representative survey data and is the first to examine the social predictors of belief in conspiracy theories in Spain during the pandemic. The findings highlight that conspiracy theory beliefs are (a) associated with considerably worse vaccination behaviors, (b) not or only very weakly associated with standard demographics such as age, sex, or education, (c) related to instrumental rationality considerations, and (d) only weakly related to value-rationality indicators such as ideological and religious affiliations. In conclusion, the study underscores the significance of public health policies that specifically address conspiracy theory convictions, and to that end, advocates for the application of a Weberian sociological perspective to better understand the diverse rationalities underlying these beliefs, particularly in the absence of discernible demographic predictors."
37796962,The impacts of COVID-19 on seafood prices in Japan: A comparison between cheap and luxury products.,"Like many other countries, the economy and society of Japan have been severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, and the fishery sector particularly seafood is no exception. Among seafood, since luxury seafood is more commonly consumed at restaurants it has a higher possibility of getting affected by the pandemic compared with cheap popular seafood for the masses. Considering this motivation, this study investigates the variations in the COVID-19 impact on luxury and cheap seafood prices in the Tokyo Toyosu wholesale market. Using the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag model (NARDL), the study identifies that an increase in the hours of stay-at-home during the initial stage of the pandemic is causing a negative influence on both cheap and luxury seafood prices and that this negative impact was severer in the luxury seafood prices. The study also finds a positive influence from the hours of stay-at-home on some cheap popular seafood like horse mackerel and sardine during the third state of emergency (SOE) where at least most of the elderly people have received their first vaccine dose but the negative impact from the SOE measure remained on luxury seafood. It is evident from the findings that the luxury seafood market is heavily dependent on the restaurant sector, which will likely suffer adverse effects when human mobility is restricted. In the event of a pandemic like COVID-19, policymakers should stabilize the price and provide subsidies to the luxury seafood stakeholders."

We conducted a cross-sectional, anonymous survey in October 2021 using established quantitative methods of virtual surveys to reach tribal members living on three reservations in the Great Plains (N = 679). We conducted multivariate analyses using logistic regression to assess the association between independent variables and COVID-19 vaccination status after adjusting for confounding. Respondents were more likely to have received a COVID-19 vaccine if they were older, had a full-time job, had previously received a flu vaccination, reported a higher level of trust in the health care system, had increased access to vaccinations, were able to isolate, or if they held a desire to keep their family safe. This study is one of the first to offer insights into the associations and possible determinants of COVID-19 vaccine uptake among American Indians in the Great Plains and was completed as part of the National Institutes of Health Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics of Underserved Populations consortium. We identified a set of demographic, socioeconomic, and motivational factors that are associated with COVID-19 vaccination uptake among Great Plains American Indians and Alaska Natives. It is possible that future vaccine uptake may be enhanced through economic development, strengthening health care operations and care quality, and focusing vaccination messaging on family and community impact."

This strategic review described the role of social media platforms in creating and reinforcing an infodemic during health pandemics in Africa. The inclusion criteria for the review were African research on infodemics on social media during pandemics, epidemics or endemics in the past 10 years. A structured literature review, making use of the Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, Research (SPIDER) scoping review methodology framework, identified scholarly publications from various academic databases. A total of 41 articles met the eligibility criteria. The six factors identified included stakeholders, socio-economic context, conspiracy theories, sources of information, government responses and verification mechanisms. The findings of this study indicate that governments needs to include infodemics in the risk communication strategy for public health emergencies. Verification of misinformation can mitigate the effects of conspiracy theories while the socio-economic context of the audience will influence planning strategies to mitigate infodemics on social media."

Until the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, TB was the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. COVID-19 has caused enormous health, social and economic upheavals since 2020, impairing access to essential TB services. In marked contrast to the steady global increase in TB detection between 2017 and 2019, TB notifications dropped substantially in 2020 compared with 2019 (-18%), with only a partial recovery in 2021. TB epidemiology worsened during the pandemic: the estimated 10.6 million people who fell ill with TB worldwide in 2021 is an increase of 4.5% from the previous year, reversing many years of slow decline. The annual number of TB deaths worldwide fell steadily between 2005 and 2019, reaching 1.4 million in 2019, but this trend was reversed in 2020 (1.5 million), and by 2021 global TB deaths were back to the level of 2017 (1.6 million). Intensified efforts backed by increased funding are urgently required to reverse the negative impacts of COVID-19 on TB worldwide, made more pressing by ongoing conflicts, a global energy crisis and uncertainties in food security that are likely to worsen the broader determinants of TB."

Among these measures, the implementation of personal protective equipment (PPE) and its appropriate use in the workplace is key to avoiding contagion, as is understanding new measures regarding patient admission, distribution, constant education on virtual platforms, among others, and changing conduct to reduce contagion. However, behavioral change interventions in healthcare workers are challenging as contextual characteristics, attributes of the intervention, and psychological factors are involved."

37794286,COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Financial Hardships and Adolescents' Adjustment: A Longitudinal Family Stress Approach.,"Restrictions associated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic created a host of short- and long-term economic challenges for families. Despite their ubiquity during the early pandemic, knowledge on the developmental impacts of pandemic-related financial hardships on adolescents' adjustment is lacking. Guided by family stress and life course perspectives, this study investigated direct and indirect relations between pandemic-related financial hardships and adolescents' later depressive symptoms, delinquency, and academic performance via parents' depressive symptoms and acceptance. Data were drawn from three waves of a longitudinal study; participants completed online surveys at Wave 1, COVID-19 Wave (seven months later) and Wave 2 (five months later). Participants were two adolescent-aged siblings (n = 1364; 50% female; Mage = 14.45, SD = 1.55 years) and one parent (n = 682; 85% female; Mage = 45.15, SD = 5.37 years) from 682 families (N = 2048). Structural equation modeling results indicated that pandemic-related financial hardships were indirectly linked to greater adolescent delinquency and lower academic performance by adversely shaping parents' mental health and parent-adolescent relationship quality. The findings highlight financial hardships as critical family stressors for adolescent adjustment during the COVID-19 pandemic."

37792594,Community Outreach in Breast Imaging: What Radiologists Can Do to Close the Gap for the Uninsured Population.,"After implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, the uninsured population of the United States decreased significantly. As of 2022, there were approximately 26.4 million uninsured individuals in the United States. The lack of coverage and access to services disproportionally affect minority groups in the country, reflecting the influence of the social determinants of health in their uninsured status. Use of screening mammography, an effective modality that results in early detection of and decreased mortality from breast cancer, was delayed or postponed by women of all races due to lockdowns and fear during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, the return to mammographic screening has lagged among minorities, further increasing their disproportionate screening gap. Radiologists-and more specifically breast imagers-must recognize these issues, as people who are uninsured and part of minority groups are diagnosed with breast cancer at later stages and have higher mortality rates, less continuity of care, and overall lower survival. The purpose of this article is to familiarize radiologists with the uninsured population, explain how they are disproportionally affected by breast cancer, and propose strategies that breast imagers can pursue to improve screening access and decrease compliance gaps for this patient population.

37791078,"Uncertainty, Anxiety and the Post-Pandemic Economic Environment.","There is ample evidence from medical and social sciences that economic crises impact on individual mental health. This makes neuro-psychiatric dynamics and individual mental health, particularly that of entrepreneurs, relevant for economic policy designers. At the same time, economic policies can have an impact on mental health, reducing or increasing economic uncertainty and, consequently, changing the level of anxiety in individuals. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a severe economic crisis and a drastic transformation of the European economic environment. However, the severity and impact of this crisis differ from many other economic and financial setbacks of the past, including the one resulting from the 2008 crisis. Moreover, the consequences of the pandemic on mental health will add to the long-term consequences of the 2010s crisis and the effects of the war at Europe's Eastern borders. Together, the three crises may increase economic uncertainty in the post-pandemic World and its impact on mental health. This essay examines the connections between economic uncertainty, anxiety, and mental health. It suggests considering some relevant elements to estimate the impact of economic uncertainty on individual mental health. Also, hypotheses about the consequences of the ""three crises shock"" on mental health in the post-pandemic World are advanced. Finally, the essay helps anticipate how the EU anti-crisis economic policies may generate needs and opportunities for mental health care in national health systems."

37789860,True prevalence of long COVID in children: a narrative review.,"Contrary to what is true for adults, little is known about pediatric long COVID (LC). Studies enrolling children are relatively few and extremely heterogeneous. This does not allow to draw definitive conclusions on the frequency and pathogenesis of pediatric LC and limits the development of appropriate and effective measures to contain the clinical, social and economic impact of this condition on the pediatric population. Depending on the methods used to collect and analyze data, studies have found that the incidence rate of pediatric LC may vary from about 25% to less than 5%. However, despite true prevalence of pediatric LC cannot be exactly defined, studies comparing children with previous COVID-19 and uninfected controls have shown that most of the clinical manifestations detected in infected children, mainly mood symptoms, mental health disorders and heart abnormalities could be diagnosed with similar frequency and severity in uninfected subjects also. This seems to indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of pediatric LC only in a part of children and other factors play a relevant role in this regard. Pandemic itself with the persistent disruption of child lives may have caused persistent stress in all the pediatric population causing mood symptoms, mental health disorders or several organ and body system functional alterations, regardless SARS-CoV-2 infection. These suppositions suggest the need for long-term physical control of all the children after COVID-19 especially when they were already suffering from an underlying disease or have had a severe disease. Moreover, attention should be paid to the assessment of change in children's emotional and behavioral functioning in order to assure adequate interventions for the best emotional and behavioral well being. However, whatever its origin, it seems highly likely that the prevalence of the pediatric LC is set to decline in the future. Preliminary observations seem to suggest that recently developed SARS-CoV-2 variants are associated with less severe COVID-19. This suggests that, as already seen in adults, a lower number of pediatric virus-associated LC cases should occur. Furthermore, the use of COVID-19 vaccines, reducing incidence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, may reduce risk of LC development. Finally, elimination of restrictive measures should significantly reduce mood symptoms and mental health disorders."

37787611,Diagnosing viral infections through T cell receptor sequencing of activated CD8+ T cells.,"T cell-based diagnostic tools identify pathogen exposure, but lack differentiation between recent and historic exposures in acute infectious diseases. Here, T cell receptor (TCR) RNA sequencing was performed on HLADR+/CD38+ CD8+ T cell subsets of hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 30; ten of whom had previously been exposed to SARS-CoV-2). CDR3α and CDR3β TCR regions were clustered separately before epitope specificity annotation using a database of SARS-CoV-2 associated CDR3α and CDR3β sequences corresponding to >1000 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. The depth of the SARS-CoV-2 associated CDR3α/β sequences differentiated COVID-19 patients from the healthy controls with a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84 ± 0.10. Hence, annotating TCR sequences of activated CD8+ T cells can be used to diagnose an acute viral infection and discriminate it from historic exposure. In essence, this work presents a new paradigm of applying the T cell repertoire to accomplish TCR-based diagnostics."
37787158,Continuity and Rupture in Crisis: from Ebola to COVID-19 in Sierra Leone and the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.,"This article examines the experience of healthcare professionals working in primary healthcare provision during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in North Kivu, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in Kambia District, Sierra Leone. Drawing on ethnographic observation, interviews and focus groups, we explore everyday narratives of 'crisis' in these two regions which had recently seen Ebola epidemics. In describing the impact of COVID-19 on their life, work, and relationships with patients, healthcare workers made sense of the pandemic in relation to broader experiences of structural economic and political crisis, as well as differing experiences of recent Ebola epidemics. There were contradictory experiences of rupture and continuity: whilst COVID-19 disrupted routine health provision and exacerbated tensions with patients, the pandemic was also described as continuity, interacting with broader structural problems and longer-term experiences of 'crisis'. In effect, healthcare workers experienced the COVID-19 pandemic at the crossroads between the exceptional and the everyday, where states of exception brought by emergency measures shed new light on long-standing tensions and structural crisis."

We surveyed young people about their needs and experiences, critical to engaging them and designing effective programs and policies to address these intersecting harms. The 2022 round of a national online survey through the Violence Outcomes in COVID-19 Epoch (VoCes) Study surveyed 152,088 Mexican youth (15-24 years). Logistic regressions were implemented to identify characteristics associated with four climate responses (economic, work-related, receiving government support, or social network support). Overall, 8.1% of participants experienced a recent climate hazard, with major impacts including housing damage from floods, and crop/livestock losses from drought. Participants who experienced a climate hazard were more likely to have experienced a pandemic-related harm, suggesting a dual impact. Poor youth were more likely to report economic losses from both the pandemic and a climate event but least likely to receive government support. Economic effects from the pandemic are exacerbating climate-related harms, unequally threatening the poorest youth. Engaging young people in decision-making and supporting the most vulnerable youth is critical for the next generation to thrive."

However, its use is not without risks. This study assessed the profile and associated factors with the traditional use of medicinal plants. To this end, a cross-sectional survey study was conducted in a southeastern Brazilian city. Descriptive analysis was performed by frequency distribution and median and interquartile range. Associated factors with the use of medicinal plants were analyzed using Poisson regression with robust variance. A total of 641 people were interviewed, of whom 258 (40.2%) reported using medicinal plants. A total of 79 distinct plants were identified, of whom Melissa officinalis (31.0%), Peumus boldus (24.4%), Mentha spicata (20.9%), Matricaria recutita L. (18.2%), Rosmarinus officinalis (17.0%), and Foeniculum vulgare (14.7%) were the most used. There were no reports of medicinal plants used to treat COVID-19. However, anxiety was the most frequently cited indication for using medicinal plants, a health condition exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the use of medicinal plants for treating respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms similar to those in COVID-19 has been identified. There was an association between the use of medicinal plants and females, non-white, lower schooling, higher income, and comorbidities."

37782803,Unraveling complex causal processes that affect sustainability requires more integration between empirical and modeling approaches.,"Scientists seek to understand the causal processes that generate sustainability problems and determine effective solutions. Yet, causal inquiry in nature-society systems is hampered by conceptual and methodological challenges that arise from nature-society interdependencies and the complex dynamics they create. Here, we demonstrate how sustainability scientists can address these challenges and make more robust causal claims through better integration between empirical analyses and process- or agent-based modeling. To illustrate how these different epistemological traditions can be integrated, we present four studies of air pollution regulation, natural resource management, and the spread of COVID-19. The studies show how integration can improve empirical estimates of causal effects, inform future research designs and data collection, enhance understanding of the complex dynamics that underlie observed temporal patterns, and elucidate causal mechanisms and the contexts in which they operate. These advances in causal understanding can help sustainability scientists develop better theories of phenomena where social and ecological processes are dynamically intertwined and prior causal knowledge and data are limited. The improved causal understanding also enhances governance by helping scientists and practitioners choose among potential interventions, decide when and how the timing of an intervention matters, and anticipate unexpected outcomes. Methodological integration, however, requires skills and efforts of all involved to learn how members of the respective other tradition think and analyze nature-society systems."

However, their readiness for infection prevention and control (IPC) as a referral hospital in providing COVID-19 services has not been determined. This study aims to evaluate the IPC structure of 30 private non-profit Indonesian referral hospitals for COVID-19 based on the World Health Organization Infection Prevention and Control Assessment Framework (WHO IPCAF). A descriptive cross-sectional quantitative study was used, where 30 hospitals as the COVID-19 referral hospital were selected. The data collection was conducted by an online survey using the IPCAF questionnaire created by the WHO and was analysed with descriptive analysis. The majority of the hospitals' IPC level is at an advanced level (73.3%). All type B hospitals have an advanced IPC level, while only 64.7% of type C and 71.4% of type D have an advanced level. The highest average IPC score is on the IPC guidelines component (94.0), while the lowest value of 71.9 is on the Surveillance of HAIs component. In the minimum scores, there were hospitals with the lowest scores in HAI Surveillance and Multimodal strategies, namely 20.0 and 25.0, respectively. Preparing human resource capacities, establishing functional programmes, developing and implementing IPC guidelines, and providing adequate supplies are needed to improve hospital IPC structures."
37781102,The use of the integrated cognitive assessment to improve the efficiency of primary care referrals to memory services in the accelerating dementia pathway technologies study.,"Current primary care cognitive assessment tools are either crude or time-consuming instruments that can only detect cognitive impairment when it is well established. This leads to unnecessary or late referrals to memory services, by which time the disease may have already progressed into more severe stages. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some memory services have adapted to the new environment by shifting to remote assessments of patients to meet service user demand. However, the use of remote cognitive assessments has been inconsistent, and there has been little evaluation of the outcome of such a change in clinical practice. Emerging research has highlighted computerized cognitive tests, such as the Integrated Cognitive Assessment (ICA), as the leading candidates for adoption in clinical practice. This is true both during the pandemic and in the post-COVID-19 era as part of healthcare innovation."

37780774,Understanding mental health conditions and key coping strategies utilized during major lockdowns in the Caribbean based on Google trends searches.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted countries to implement extended Shelter in Place Orders (SIPOs) to restrict population movement and mitigate community spread. While these lockdown measures may be effective in containing the virus, they can substantially impact the population's well-being, potentially undermining their overall welfare. This study investigates whether major lockdowns implemented in the Caribbean produced differential changes in mental health among key English-Speaking Caribbean countries. More importantly, unlike past studies, we examine key coping strategies persons utilize during major lockdowns. Finally, this paper utilizes a novel near real-time high-frequency data source in Google Trends data analytics to assess mental health patterns and coping strategies among major Caribbean countries. Based on the results of difference-in-difference and event study models, we find positive and significant increases in searches for fear, depression, and suicide during key lockdown periods, which suggest negative mental health effects. Regarding coping strategies, searches for Zoom, learning, books, exercise, prayer, religion, and meditation increased, together with searches for addiction and marijuana. These results indicate the types of programs health administrators and policymakers can implement during lockdown periods to help local mental health communities, particularly among island communities."

37779733,Postpartum Depression Among Mothers of Infants Hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Background Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalization of newborn babies has been shown to have a negative impact on the mental health of postpartum women. The mental health of new mothers may be further burdened by the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on social, economic, and psychological dimensions. This study aimed to evaluate postpartum depression and related factors in mothers of infants hospitalized in NICU during two distinct COVID-19 pandemic periods and examine any additional effects of the pandemic on the mental health of postpartum women. Methodology The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) was applied to 250 NICU mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The first 125 women's children were hospitalized during a period of high number of cases and deaths when restrictions were in place for NICU parental visits (November 2021 to February 2022, the early group). The remaining 125 women completed the scale when there was a lower number of cases and restrictions had been eased (March to June 2022, the late group). Results In the early group, the EPDS scores were statistically higher (7.53.9 vs. 5.63.4; p < 0.001), smoking and NICU stay duration were significantly higher (p = 0.01), whereas the duration of marriage was significantly lower (p = 0.01). Women in the late group with EPDS scores ≥13 were statistically less educated (p = 0.01). EPDS scores ≥13 were significantly associated with depression during pregnancy and with a history of abortion/stillbirth/neonatal death (odds ratio (OR) = 5.240, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.114 to 27.967, p = 0.03 and OR = 1.641, 95% CI = 1.009 to 2.669, p = 0.04, respectively). Conclusions NICU admission is a significant maternal risk factor for postpartum depression due to the disruption of maternal-infant bonding, and this risk may be exacerbated during times of global public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression during pregnancy and the presence of a perinatal loss may also contribute to worse postpartum mental outcomes in NICU mothers."

Methods Patients with primary viral pneumonia other than COVID-19, who underwent lung tissue biopsy, were retrospectively studied. Patients Forty-three patients (41 living patients and 2 autopsied cases) were included in the study. Results Nine patients had SLI, whereas most of patients who recovered from primary viral pneumonia showed a nonspecific epithelial injury pattern. One patient underwent a biopsy under mechanical ventilation. Two of 8 (25.0%) patients on ambient air or low-flow oxygen therapy progressed to a severe respiratory condition and then to death, while only 1 (3.1%) of 32 patients without SLI progressed to a severe respiratory condition and death (p=0.096).

37777896,Psychological Distress among Health Professional Students during Covid-19 Pandemic.,"The Corona virus pandemic has arisen as a truly intimidating threat to the very existence of humankind. Isolation, contact boundaries and economic blackout impose a complete transformation to the psychosocial environment in affected countries. The psychological impairments are significant to the diagnosed cases, suspected cases, quarantine cases, health workers and their families and also relatives. In this unprecedented global crisis situation created by Covid-19, it is very important and critical to recognize the mental shock that can affect people in different ways around the globe. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the levels of Psychological distress among Health Professional students in Bangladesh. Data collection was done through online questionnaire. Participants were asked to complete the socio-demographic data, the 6 item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6), acute stress reaction (ASR) using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) scale and any history of bitter experience during childhood, previous psychological illness, internet addiction and relationship with family. By using logistic regression, we examined the associations of the above variables with psychological distress and ASR. Among the 281 respondents, 97(34.52%) students reported high psychological distress, while 123(43.77%) had the criteria for acute stress reaction in response to the Covid-19 outbreak. A total of 39(13.87%) students showed signs of both distress and acute stress reaction. An increased psychological distress was found with previous psychological illness (OR 1.378, 95% CI 0.719-2.642). In contrast, good family functioning was associated with decreased risks of distress (OR 0.385, 95% CI 0.242-0.613) and acute stress reaction (OR 0.812, 95% CI 0.529-1.249). The study result shows that the group which is mostly affected psychologically after the corona virus pandemic are women. Almost one-third respondents had a significant psychological impact. This result suggests us further systematic and longitudinal assessment of psychological needs among the populations. Therefore, in further psychiatric planning priority should be there for this finding."

A national multicenter observational cross-sectional anonymous online survey was conducted on patients with RD using a specially developed web-based platform and structured questionnaire https://rheumatologycovid19.bg/ . The study was carried out with the support of intra-university project №6/2022 MU-Plovdiv. 1288 patients participated, with an average age of 47.03 (SD ± 12.80 years), of whom 992 (81.6%) were women. The questionnaire contained 41 questions grouped into 5 panels. Descriptive statistics were used-mean, alternative analysis, logistic regression and Decision Tree using the CRT (classification and regression trees) method. The study found that RD patients' satisfaction with access to medical services was influenced by communication type and the frequency of visits to the rheumatologist, difficulties in prescribing and finding medicines and the presence of comorbidities. The likelihood of patients' satisfaction with their rheumatologist was 5.5 and 3 times higher for in-person and other means of communication, respectively, compared to those without any communication. The relative share of patients who communicated by phone was larger (59%) compared to pre-pandemic (41%), where direct contact with the physician prevailed (80%). The results of the study confirmed the need to optimize remote access to medical care for patients with RD during the pandemic."
37773859,Resource allocation decisions under pandemic conditions: A cross-sectional survey of Ontario physicians.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced physicians to confront difficult choices regarding the allocation of scarce resources, such as ventilators and critical care beds. Developing policies to guide the allocation of such resources has proven challenging. An understanding of physicians' attitudes and beliefs surrounding resource allocation could help inform policymaking. As a replication and extension of a survey of Ottawa physicians conducted in 2020, we surveyed physicians across Ontario, Canada in April 2021. This survey examined physicians' sense of preparedness to allocate critical care resources during the pandemic, attitudes concerning resource allocation policy, and approaches to resource allocation decision-making. Of the 253 responses included for analysis, the majority (67%) of respondents indicated feeling ""somewhat"" or ""a little prepared"" to make resource allocation decisions, while 20% indicated feeling ""not at all prepared."" Most respondents (86%) agreed that a policy to guide resource allocation in the event of scarcity should exist. Physicians overwhelmingly agreed that important factors to consider when making resource allocation decisions included the patient likelihood of survival, frailty index, comorbidities, and cognitive status. Responses from the province-wide survey conducted in 2021 resemble the results of an analogous survey of Ottawa physicians conducted in 2020. Physicians generally felt underprepared to make resource allocation decisions and agreed that official policies should guide such decisions. Identification of factors relevant to resource allocation was remarkably consistent across this sample and that taken in 2020."

37770515,"Inequity in mortality rates and potential years of life lost caused by COVID-19 in the Greater Santiago, Chile.","Several studies have shown that, in Chile, income inequality is relevant in explaining health inequities. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a negative impact, with higher mortality rates in those municipalities of Greater Santiago with lower socioeconomic status. We study inequity in mortality based on Potential Years of Life Lost (PYLL) in 34 urban municipalities of the Metropolitan Region (Greater Santiago) and analyze its evolution between 2018 and 2021 and by COVID-19 waves. To compare the results obtained for PYLL, we also computed the mortality rates adjusted by direct standardization. In addition, we used the concentration index (CI) to measure the health inequalities between municipalities. In the first year of the pandemic, the absolute PYLL and the standardized mortality rate for all causes of death showed an increase of 13.6% and 18.9%, respectively. Moreover, 409,086 years of life were prematurely lost in 2020, one-fifth of them due to COVID-19. The concentration indices confirm inequality in both mortality rates and PYLL, where it is more pronounced when calculating the latter measure. Results show that the deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic affected the most economically disadvantaged municipalities, and particularly young people in those places."
37768975,Dynamic evolution of policy mix in response to COVID-19: Practice from China.,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic. In response to this unprecedented crisis, Chinese government formulated a series of policies. This research is dedicated to exploring the dynamic evolution of China's policy mix in response to COVID-19 in different crisis response stages from a network perspective. First, a three-dimensional analysis framework of ""policy subject-policy target-policy instrument"" was developed. Then, based on the data sets collected by textual analysis, the dynamic evolution of policy subject, policy target, policy instrument in China's policy mix in response to COVID-19 was discussed by using the method of SNA. This study concluded that the core policy subject, policy instrument, and policy target of China's response to COVID-19 changed with time. National Health Commission (NHC), Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Transport (MOT) and Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MHRSS) have important influences in the network of policy subjects. Other subjects are more at the edge of the network, and there are few joint issuances among policy subjects. The study also found that the core policy target was adjusted over time, with phased dynamic characteristics. At the initial stage of China's response to COVID-19, ""reduce infection and mortality"" and ""steadily carry out economic and social work"" were the core policy targets. With the COVID-19 under control, ""enterprise development and work resumption"" becomes a new core policy target. In addition, this study also revealed the dynamic evolution and unbalanced use of China's policy instruments in response to COVID-19 in different stages. The combination of policy instruments is mainly composed of ""mandatory administration instruments"" and ""economic incentive instruments"", and supplemented by ""health promotion instruments"" and ""voluntary plan instruments"". These findings may enrich the literature on COVID-19 policy to help researchers understand the dynamics of policy from a network perspective. Moreover, these findings may provide several valuable implications for policymakers and other countries to formulate more effective policies for epidemic response."
37768959,Analyzing influence of COVID-19 on crypto & financial markets and sentiment analysis using deep ensemble model.,"COVID-19 affected the world's economy severely and increased the inflation rate in both developed and developing countries. COVID-19 also affected the financial markets and crypto markets significantly, however, some crypto markets flourished and touched their peak during the pandemic era. This study performs an analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on public opinion and sentiments regarding the financial markets and crypto markets. It conducts sentiment analysis on tweets related to financial markets and crypto markets posted during COVID-19 peak days. Using sentiment analysis, it investigates the people's sentiments regarding investment in these markets during COVID-19. In addition, damage analysis in terms of market value is also carried out along with the worse time for financial and crypto markets. For analysis, the data is extracted from Twitter using the SNSscraper library. This study proposes a hybrid model called CNN-LSTM (convolutional neural network-long short-term memory model) for sentiment classification. CNN-LSTM outperforms with 0.89, and 0.92 F1 Scores for crypto and financial markets, respectively. Moreover, topic extraction from the tweets is also performed along with the sentiments related to each topic."

37767517,A theoretical review on the role of knowledge sharing and intellectual capital in employees' innovative behaviors at work.,"With the rapid growth of technologies, sciences, and globalization, many organizations have modified and updated their managerial policies to meet modern requirements. To survive difficulties and setbacks, especially unexpected crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies turned their attention to employees' knowledge sharing, intellectual capital, and innovative thoughts and behaviors to gain wealth, value, and success. Given the severe shock that the pandemic exerted on many countries' economy, the psycho-emotional and individual aspects of work obtained unprecedented scholarly attention. However, the way knowledge sharing and intellectual capital can interact to foster and enhance innovation at workplaces has remained under-researched. To fill this gap, the present review article presented the theoretical and empirical foundations of these three factors and stressed their possible interplay. In the end, some implications and suggestions for further research were offered to managers and eager researchers to practically and scientifically examine the interplay of knowledge sharing, intellectual capital, and innovative work behaviors."
37767093,Rationale for combined therapies in severe-to-critical COVID-19 patients.,"An unprecedented global social and economic impact as well as a significant number of fatalities have been brought on by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), produced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Acute SARS-CoV-2 infection can, in certain situations, cause immunological abnormalities, leading to an anomalous innate and adaptive immune response. While most patients only experience mild symptoms and recover without the need for mechanical ventilation, a substantial percentage of those who are affected develop severe respiratory illness, which can be fatal. The absence of effective therapies when disease progresses to a very severe condition coupled with the incomplete understanding of COVID-19's pathogenesis triggers the need to develop innovative therapeutic approaches for patients at high risk of mortality. As a result, we investigate the potential contribution of promising combinatorial cell therapy to prevent death in critical patients."

37766331,Bridging the Gap: Can COVID-19 Research Help Combat African Swine Fever?,"African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious and economically devastating disease affecting domestic pigs and wild boar, caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV). Despite being harmless to humans, ASF poses significant challenges to the swine industry, due to sudden losses and trade restrictions. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has spurred an unparalleled global research effort, yielding remarkable advancements across scientific disciplines. In this review, we explore the potential technological spillover from COVID-19 research into ASF. Specifically, we assess the applicability of the diagnostic tools, vaccine development strategies, and biosecurity measures developed for COVID-19 for combating ASF. Additionally, we discuss the lessons learned from the pandemic in terms of surveillance systems and their implications for managing ASF. By bridging the gap between COVID-19 and ASF research, we highlight the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration and technological spillovers in the battle against ASF."
37766178,Key Considerations during the Transition from the Acute Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been met with an unprecedented response from the scientific community, leading to the development, investigation, and authorization of vaccines and antivirals, ultimately reducing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on global public health. However, SARS-CoV-2 is far from being eradicated, continues to evolve, and causes substantial health and economic burdens. In this narrative review, we posit essential points on SARS-CoV-2 and its responsible management during the transition from the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. As discussed, despite Omicron (sub)variant(s) causing clinically milder infections, SARS-CoV-2 is far from being a negligible pathogen. It requires continued genomic surveillance, particularly if one considers that its future (sub)lineages do not necessarily have to be milder. Antivirals and vaccines remain the essential elements in COVID-19 management. However, the former could benefit from further development and improvements in dosing, while the seasonal administration of the latter requires simplification to increase interest and tackle vaccine hesitancy. It is also essential to ensure the accessibility of COVID-19 pharmaceuticals and vaccines in low-income countries and improve the understanding of their use in the context of the long-term goals of SARS-CoV-2 management. Regardless of location, the primary role of COVID-19 awareness and education must be played by healthcare workers, who directly communicate with patients and serve as role models for healthy behaviors."
37766148,The Key Site Variation and Immune Challenges in SARS-CoV-2 Evolution.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide public health and economic threat, and virus variation amplifies the difficulty in epidemic prevention and control. The structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been studied extensively and is now well defined. The S protein is the most distinguishing feature in terms of infection and immunity, mediating virus entrance and inducing neutralizing antibodies. The S protein and its essential components are also the most promising target to develop vaccines and antibody-based drugs. Therefore, the key site mutation in the S gene is of high interest. Among them, RBD, NTD, and furin cleavage sites are the most mutable regions with the most mutation sites and the most serious consequences for SARS-CoV-2 biological characteristics, including infectivity, pathogenicity, natural immunity, vaccine efficacy, and antibody therapeutics. We are also aware that this outbreak may not be the last. Therefore, in this narrative review, we summarized viral variation and prevalence condition, discussed specific amino acid replacement and associated immune challenges and attempted to sum up some prevention and control strategies by reviewing the literature on previously published research about SARS-CoV-2 variation to assist in clarifying the mutation pathway and consequences of SARS-CoV-2 for developing countermeasures against such viruses as soon as possible."
37766137,"Effectiveness of the Booster Dose in Protecting against COVID-19, Colombia 2022.","Vaccination has proven to be one of the most effective strategies against the COVID-19 pandemic. Several studies have evaluated and confirmed its effectiveness in different populations, particularly in reducing severe outcomes such as hospitalization and death. Some studies have investigated the effectiveness of vaccination against the infection, identifying the need for booster doses. This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of the vaccination schedule on the probability of infection in a sample of Colombian patients during the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was associated with the emergence and predominance of the Omicron variant. A cross-sectional study was conducted on individuals who underwent RT-PCR testing for COVID-19 detection in a dedicated laboratory in Bogotá, Colombia, between 30 December 2021 and 7 February 2022. A total of 1468 subjects was included in the study, of whom 36.6% (n = 538) had a positive PCR test for COVID-19. The comparison between fully vaccinated individuals with a booster dose and those without the booster dose revealed a 28% reduction in the odds of infection (OR = 0.719 CI 0.531-0.971). Age (OR = 1.009 CI 1.001-1.018) and low economic status (OR = 1.812 CI 1.416-2.319) were associated with an increased risk of infection. These findings suggest the need for a booster vaccination in the general population to improve the prevention rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mitigate severe outcomes."
37766133,Population-Level Immunity for Transient Suppression of COVID-19 Waves in Japan from April 2021 to September 2022.,"Multiple COVID-19 waves have been observed worldwide, with varying numbers of positive cases. Population-level immunity can partly explain a transient suppression of epidemic waves, including immunity acquired after vaccination strategies. In this study, we aimed to estimate population-level immunity in 47 Japanese prefectures during the three waves from April 2021 to September 2022. For each wave, characterized by the predominant variants, namely, Delta, Omicron, and BA.5, the estimated rates of population-level immunity in the 10-64-years age group, wherein the most positive cases were observed, were 20%, 35%, and 45%, respectively. The number of infected cases in the BA.5 wave was inversely associated with the vaccination rates for the second and third injections. We employed machine learning to replicate positive cases in three Japanese prefectures to validate the reliability of our model for population-level immunity. Using interpolation based on machine learning, we estimated the impact of behavioral factors and vaccination on the fifth wave of new positive cases that occurred during the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Our computational results highlighted the critical role of population-level immunity, such as vaccination, in infection suppression. These findings underscore the importance of estimating and monitoring population-level immunity to predict the number of infected cases in future waves. Such estimations that combine numerical derivation and machine learning are of utmost significance for effective management of medical resources, including the vaccination strategy."
37766112,HPV Opportunistic Vaccination: A Literature Review and a Single-Center Experience in Northern Italy through the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) set the goal of 90% HPV vaccination coverage in the population to eliminate cervical cancer. Opportunistic vaccination is performed outside the free vaccination or catch-up programs. Both free and opportunistic HPV vaccination programs experienced slowdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this retrospective study, we aimed to identify the benefits and the obstacles of opportunistic vaccination among male and female individuals who took advantage of the ""on-demand"" service offered by San Raffaele Hospital in Milan from April 2018 to May 2023. The impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on vaccination adherence was also analyzed. Data on a total of 527 subjects were collected from an in-house database and through personal interviews. Women in the cohort of older patients (over 25) adhered to the vaccination schedule more than younger women. Opportunistic vaccination request is influenced by the need of a gynecologist, a general practitioner, or public health clinic availability. Women also showed good adherence to screening, demonstrating awareness of the importance of cervical cancer secondary prevention despite vaccination. Opportunistic vaccination offers the possibility of including individuals excluded from the free vaccination campaigns, often already affected by lesions caused by HPV, providing increased viral clearance and faster lesion regression. The main limit remains the economic burden."
37766072,The Relationship of COVID-19 Vaccination Status with Health Literacy of Syrians Living in Istanbul.,"Health literacy is an important determinant of health care use among refugees and migrant communities. This present study aimed to evaluate the relationship between health literacy levels, sociodemographic characteristics, and the status of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine in Syrians under ""Temporary Protection"" in Istanbul. This study was conducted in February, March, and May 2022 in an Extended Migrant Health Center in Istanbul, with a survey prepared in Arabic under observation. A total of 571 questionnaires were analyzed. The mean age of the participants was 31.92 ± 6.14, and 80.7% were female and 26.6% were high school graduates. A total of 55.0% of Syrians have not had any of the COVID-19 vaccines. The health literacy level of 1.1% of the immigrants was determined as ""excellent"", 68.7% as ""inadequate"", 20.7% as ""problematic/limited"", and 9.6% as ""adequate"". According to the logistic regression model, being male, of elder age, middle and above economic status, and having a chronic disease in the family were determined as the variables associated with the status of being vaccinated against COVID-19. Refugees are a group often exposed to inequalities in access to health services. Increasing health literacy in these groups will provide a significant improvement in access to and use of health services."
37764378,Indole-Based Compounds as Potential Drug Candidates for SARS-CoV-2.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a significant threat to society in recent times, endangering human health, life, and economic well-being. The disease quickly spreads due to the highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has undergone numerous mutations. Despite intense research efforts by the scientific community since its emergence in 2019, no effective therapeutics have been discovered yet. While some repurposed drugs have been used to control the global outbreak and save lives, none have proven universally effective, particularly for severely infected patients. Although the spread of the disease is generally under control, anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents are still needed to combat current and future infections. This study reviews some of the most promising repurposed drugs containing indolyl heterocycle, which is an essential scaffold of many alkaloids with diverse bio-properties in various biological fields. The study also discusses natural and synthetic indole-containing compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties and computer-aided drug design (in silico studies) for optimizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 hits/leads."
37764127,Design and Assessment of a Novel In Silico Approach for Developing a Next-Generation Multi-Epitope Universal Vaccine Targeting Coronaviruses.,"In the past two decades, there have been three coronavirus outbreaks that have caused significant economic and health crises. Biologists predict that more coronaviruses may emerge in the near future. Therefore, it is crucial to develop preventive vaccines that can effectively combat multiple coronaviruses. In this study, we employed computational approaches to analyze genetically related coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants, focusing on the spike glycoprotein as a potential vaccine candidate. By predicting common epitopes, we identified the top epitopes and combined them to create a multi-epitope candidate vaccine. The overall quality of the candidate vaccine was validated through in silico analyses, confirming its antigenicity, immunogenicity, and stability. In silico docking and simulation studies suggested a stable interaction between the multi-epitope candidate vaccine and human toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). In silico codon optimization and cloning were used to further explore the successful expression of the designed candidate vaccine in a prokaryotic expression system. Based on computational analysis, the designed candidate vaccine was found to be stable and non-allergenic in the human body. The efficiency of the multi-epitope vaccine in triggering effective cellular and humoral immune responses was assessed through immune stimulation, demonstrating that the designed candidate vaccine can elicit specific immune responses against multiple coronaviruses. Therefore, it holds promise as a potential candidate vaccine against existing and future coronaviruses."

37763290,Africa (COVID-19) Vaccine Technology Transfer: Where Are We?,"The rampant spread of the COVID-19 infection poses a grave and formidable challenge to global healthcare, with particular concern to the inhabitants of the African continent. In response to these pressing concerns, different strategies have been employed to combat the emergence of this insidious disease, encompassing crucial measures such as physical distancing, the utilization of face masks, meticulous hand hygiene, and widespread vaccination campaigns. Nevertheless, the economic realities faced by numerous African nations, characterized by their classification as ""low-income countries (LICs)"", present a formidable barrier to accessing and distributing approved vaccines to their populations. Moreover, it is essential to discuss the hesitancy of the European Union (EU) in releasing intellectual property rights associated with the transfer of vaccine technology to Africa. While the EU has been a key player in global efforts to combat the pandemic, there has been reluctance in sharing valuable knowledge and resources with African countries. This hesitancy raises concerns about equitable vaccine access and the potential for a prolonged health crisis in Africa. This review underscores the urgent imperative and need of establishing localized vaccine development and production facilities within Africa, necessitating the active involvement of governments and collaborative partnerships to achieve this crucial objective. Furthermore, this review advocates for the exploration of viable avenues for the transfer of vaccine technology as a means to facilitate equitable vaccine access across the African continent and also the cruciality and the need for the EU to reconsider its stance and actively engage in transferring vaccine technology to Africa through sharing intellectual property. The EU can contribute to the establishment of localized vaccine production facilities on the continent, which will not only increase vaccine availability but also promote self-sufficiency and resilience in the face of future health emergencies."

37761785,Evaluating the Financial Performances of the Publicly Held Healthcare Companies in Crisis Periods in Türkiye.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the financial performances of the publicly held healthcare companies in crisis periods in Türkiye. The 2018 economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic crisis were included in the study as the crisis periods. We collected the financial data of the publicly held healthcare companies and calculated three liquidity, three turnover, three leverage and three profitability ratios through ratio analysis to use as financial performance indicators. We then conducted Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and we performed separate analyses for the 2018 economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The results of the analyses showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the publicly held healthcare companies' liquidity, turnover, leverage, profitability ratios and thus their financial performances before the crises and after the crises. While the results are reassuring and give valuable insights to managers and policy makers to determine the areas that needs to be strengthened to be better prepared for possible future crises, our sample was limited. Therefore, this study presents an exploratory foundation for future studies which are needed to make a case for financial stability for the publicly held healthcare companies before and after the crisis periods."
37761753,Nurses' Experience Implementing an Automated Video Monitoring System to Decrease the Risk of Patient Falls during a Global Pandemic.,"Healthcare is a complex sociotechnical system where information systems (IS) and information technology (IT) intersect to solve problems experienced by patients and providers alike. One example of IS/IT in hospitals is the Ocuvera automated video monitoring system (AVMS), which has been implemented in more than 30 hospitals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate nurses' attitudes toward AVMS implementation over time as they received the training program developed for this intervention. Consistent with the job demands-resources (JDR) model, we found that perceptions of AVMS usefulness increased over time and were positively associated with perceptions of social influence and behavioral control. These results were consistent with our finding that there was a significant decrease in the risk of unassisted falls from the bed from baseline to intervention. Leaders in hospital systems and healthcare organizations may want to consider implementing an AVMS as researchers continue to test, verify, and demonstrate the effectiveness of these interventions for improving patient well-being."
37761750,Parent-Reported Child and Parent Quality of Life during COVID-19 Testing at an Australian Paediatric Hospital Outpatient Clinic: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Globally, we have seen a drop in adult and child quality of life (QOL) during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about adult or child QOL during the height of the pandemic in Australia and the impact of government-imposed restrictions, specifically attending school on-site versus home schooling. Our study aimed to establish if QOL in children and parents presenting to a Respiratory Infection Clinic in Victoria, Australia, for COVID-19 PCR testing differed from pre-pandemic population norms. We also explored whether on-site versus home schooling further impacted QOL. Following the child's test and prior to receiving results, consenting parents of children aged 6 to 17 years old completed the Child Health Utility 9 Dimension (CHU9D) instrument on their child's behalf. Parents of children aged birth to five years completed the EuroQOL 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) instrument on their own behalf (cross-sectional study). Data analyses utilised quantile regression, adjusting for the child's age, COVID-19 symptoms, gender and chronic health conditions. From July 2020 to November 2021, 2025 parents completed the CHU9D; the mean age for children was 8.41 years (±3.63 SD), and 48.4 per cent were female ("
37761736,Areas of Concern and Support among the Austrian General Population: A Qualitative Content Analytic Mapping of the Shift between Winter 2020/21 and Spring 2022.,"This study aimed to analyze areas of concern and support of the Austrian general population two years into the COVID-19 pandemic. A representative sample (N = 1031) of the Austrian general population was surveyed online between 19 April 2022 and 26 April 2022. A qualitative study design was used to explore the factors of most considerable current concern (Question 1) and the most important sources of support (Question 2). The responses to the two open-ended questions were evaluated using a conventional content analysis, and categories were formed according to the frequency of the answers. The analysis revealed that inflation and finances (30% of participants) and the war in Ukraine (22%) were the greatest sources of concern, followed by mental health (11%), and physical health (11%). Factors such as social contacts within and outside the family were mentioned most frequently as sources of support (36% of participants), followed by recreational activities (23%) and attitudes and abilities (22%). Compared to data collected at the end of the first year of the pandemic (between 23 December 2020 and 4 January 2021), concern about one's financial situation was now mentioned more frequently (30% vs. 8,5%). On the other hand, different types of pandemic-related concerns were mentioned less often. Social contacts and recreation were mentioned as the most important sources of support at both time points (46% and 36% of the participants). The results suggest that the economic concerns are lagging behind the restrictions imposed by the pandemic. In addition, the impending war in Ukraine seems to have a relevant impact on mental health in Austria. Further nuanced qualitative research, particularly involving vulnerable groups such as low-income individuals and the unemployed, is crucial."
37761713,Quick Transition to One Day Length of Stay after Hip and Knee Arthroplasty Using a Digital Follow-Up Tool during COVID-19: A Retrospective Comparative Study.,"The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for efficient use of hospital infrastructure. The hypothesis was that a rapid shift to outpatient surgery after hip or knee arthroplasty could be implemented without compromising quality of care. The aim of this study was to assess the safety, pain management and patient-reported outcomes before and after the implementation of an accelerated discharge program using a digital follow-up tool. A retrospective cohort design was used to compare 97 patients who received primary total hip or knee arthroplasty during the pandemic (early discharge) to comparable 194 pre-pandemic patients (normal discharge). Both cohorts had the same inclusion criteria and were closely monitored using the digital follow-up tool. The accelerated discharge program reduced length of stay from a median of 3 days (before the pandemic) to a median of 1 day (during the pandemic) ("
37761645,"Taxes, Inequality, and Equal Opportunities.","Extreme inequality represents a grave challenge for impoverished individuals and poses a threat to economic growth and stability. Despite the fulfillment of affirmative action measures aimed at promoting equal opportunities, they often prove inadequate in effectively reducing inequality. Mathematical models and simulations have demonstrated that even when equal opportunities are present, wealth tends to concentrate in the hands of a privileged few, leaving the majority of the population in dire poverty. This phenomenon, known as condensation, has been shown to be an inevitable outcome in economic models that rely on fair exchange. In light of the escalating levels of inequality in the 21st century and the significant state intervention necessitated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing number of scholars are abandoning neo-liberal ideologies. Instead, they propose a more robust role for the state in the economy, utilizing mechanisms such as taxation, regulation, and universal allocations. This paper begins with the assumption that state intervention is essential to effectively reduce inequality and to revitalize the economy. Subsequently, it conducts a comparative analysis of various taxation and redistribution mechanisms, with a particular emphasis on their impact on inequality indices, including the Gini coefficient. Specifically, it compares the effects of fortune and consumption-based taxation, as well as universal redistribution mechanisms or targeted redistribution mechanisms aimed at assisting the most economically disadvantaged individuals. The results suggest that fortune taxation are more effective than consumption-based taxation to reduce inequality."

37761277,"IVDR: Analysis of the Social, Economic, and Practical Consequences of the Application of an Ordinance of the In Vitro Diagnostic Ordinance in Switzerland.","IVDR regulation represents a major challenge for diagnostic microbiology laboratories. IVDR complicates a broad range of aspects and poses a risk given the high diversity of pathogens (including rare but highly virulent microbes) and the large variety of samples submitted for analysis. The regular emergence of new pathogens (including Echovirus E-11, Adenovirus 41, Monkeypox virus, Alongshan virus, and Enterovirus D68, as recent examples in Europe in the post SARS-CoV-2 era) is another factor that makes IVDR regulation risky, because its detrimental effect on production of in-house tests will negatively impact knowledge and expertise in the development of new diagnostic tests. Moreover, such regulations negatively impact the availability of diagnostic tests, especially for neglected pathogens, and has a detrimental effect on the overall costs of the tests. The increased regulatory burden of IVDR may thereby pose an important risk for public health. Taken together, it will have a negative impact on the financial balance of diagnostic microbiology laboratories (especially small ones). The already-high standards of quality management of all ISO-accredited and Swissmedic-authorized laboratories render IVDR law of little value, at least in Switzerland, while tremendously increasing the regulatory burden and associated costs. Eventually, patients will need to pay for diagnostic assays outside of the framework of their insurance in order to obtain a proper diagnostic assessment, which may result in social inequity. Thus, based on the risk assessment outlined above, the coordinated commission for clinical microbiology proposes adjusting the IvDO ordinance by (i) introducing an obligation to be ISO 15189 accredited and (ii) not implementing the IvDO 2028 milestone."
37760797,Development and Validation of a High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) Method for Quantification of Major Molnupiravir Metabolite (β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine) in Human Plasma.,"Molnupiravir is an antiviral drug against viral RNA polymerase activity approved by the FDA for the treatment of COVID-19, which is metabolized to β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) in human blood plasma. A novel method was developed and validated for quantifying NHC in human plasma within the analytical range of 10-10,000 ng/mL using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) to support pharmacokinetics studies. For sample preparation, the method of protein precipitation by acetonitrile was used, with promethazine as an internal standard. Chromatographic separation was carried out on a Shim-pack GWS C18 (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) column in a gradient elution mode.

37760710,Antifungal Use and Resistance in a Lower-Middle-Income Country: The Case of Lebanon.,"Antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Antifungal resistance is often underestimated in both healthcare and non-clinical settings. In LMICs, it is believed that the inappropriate use of antifungals, limited surveillance systems, and low diagnostic capacities are significant drivers of resistance. Like other LMICs, Lebanon lacks antifungal use and resistance surveillance programs, and the impact of antifungal resistance in the country remains unclear, especially during the unfolding economic crisis that has severely affected medical care and access to safe food and water. Interestingly, the widespread use of antifungals in medicine and agriculture has raised concerns about the development of antifungal resistance in Lebanon. In this light, we aimed to survey available antifungal drugs in the country and evaluate susceptibility patterns of prevalent fungal species to guide empiric treatments and develop antifungal stewardship programs in Lebanon. We noted that the economic crisis resulted in significant increases in antifungal drug prices. Additionally, a comprehensive literature search across PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases identified 15 studies on fungal infections and antifungal resistance conducted from 1998 to 2023 in Lebanon. While data on antifungal resistance are limited, 87% of available studies in Lebanon focused on candidiasis, while the remaining 13% were on aspergillosis. Overall, we observed a marked antimicrobial resistance among "
37760267,Farmers' Perspectives of the Benefits and Risks in Precision Livestock Farming in the EU Pig and Poultry Sectors.,"More efficient livestock production systems are necessary, considering that only 41% of global meat demand will be met by 2050. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic crisis has clearly illustrated the necessity of building sustainable and stable agri-food systems. Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) offers the continuous capacity of agriculture to contribute to overall human and animal welfare by providing sufficient goods and services through the application of technical innovations like digitalization. However, adopting new technologies is a challenging issue for farmers, extension services, agri-business and policymakers. We present a review of operational concepts and technological solutions in the pig and poultry sectors, as reflected in 41 and 16 European projects from the last decade, respectively. The European trend of increasing broiler-meat production, which is soon to outpace pork, stresses the need for more outstanding research efforts in the poultry industry. We further present a review of farmers' attitudes and obstacles to the acceptance of technological solutions in the pig and poultry sectors using examples and lessons learned from recent European projects. Despite the low resonance at the research level, the investigation of farmers' attitudes and concerns regarding the acceptance of technological solutions in the livestock sector should be incorporated into any technological development."

37758615,Discovery and identification of a novel canine coronavirus causing a diarrhea outbreak in Vulpes.,"Cross-species transmission of viruses from wildlife animal reservoirs, such as bats, poses a threat to human and domestic animal health. Previous studies have shown that domestic animals have important roles as intermediate hosts, enabling the transmission of genetically diverse coronaviruses from natural hosts to humans. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a novel canine coronavirus (VuCCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute diarrhea in Vulpes (foxes) in Shenyang, China. The epidemic started on November 8, 2019, and caused more than 39,600 deaths by January 1, 2022. Full-length viral genomic sequences were obtained from 15 foxes with diarrhea at the early stage of this outbreak. The VuCCoV genome shared more than 90% nucleotide identity with canine coronavirus (CCoV) for three of the four structural genes, with the S gene showing a larger amount of divergence. In addition, 67% (10/15) of the VuCCoV genomes contained an open reading frame (ORF3) gene, which was previously only detected in CCoV-I genomes. Notably, VuCCoV had only two to three amino acid differences at the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) level to bat CoV, suggesting a close genetic relationship. Therefore, these novel VuCCoV genomes represent a previously unsampled lineage of CCoVs. We also show that the VuCCoV spike protein binds to canine and fox aminopeptidase N (APN), which may allow this protein to serve as an entry receptor. In addition, cell lines were identified that are sensitive to VuCCoV using a pseudovirus system. These data highlight the importance of identifying the diversity and distribution of coronaviruses in domestic animals, which could mitigate future outbreaks that could threaten livestock, public health, and economic growth."

37756326,Assessing the size and growth of the US wetland and stream compensatory mitigation industry.,"Interest has focused on quantifying the size and scope of environmental markets, particularly those that offset ecosystem impacts or restore natural infrastructure to improve habitat or promote clean air and water. In this paper, we focus on the US wetland and stream compensatory mitigation market, asking: what types of firms make up the mitigation ""industry""? What are the economic impacts-i.e., the ""size""-of the mitigation industry? How has this industry changed over time? We present the results of a national survey of mitigation firms and construct an input-output model of the industry's economic impacts and employment. We also develop a comparative, 2014 model of the industry using data from a previous study of the broader, ecological restoration economy. Our findings suggest that the (2019, pre-COVID) mitigation industry collects annual revenues (direct economic impacts) in excess of $3.5 billion, which, along with additional indirect (supply chain) and induced (spillover) economic impacts, combine to over $9.6 billion in total output and support over 53,000 total jobs. We estimate 2014-2019 growth of ~35.2 percent in revenues, ~32.6 percent in total economic impacts, and a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.25%. This places the mitigation industry within the range of other, well-established industries within the technical services sector. We suggest establishing North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes specifically for ecological restoration and mitigation firms, an essential step in generating accurate and consistent employment estimates in the future, particularly at sub-national geographic scales."
